1.0,3,text_content,"an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul. "
1.0,4,text_content,generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather. 
1.0,5,text_content,at him where he lay in his bed. 
1.0,6,text_content,"‘round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels. "
1.0,7,text_content,"‘Is he not small for his age, Jessica?’ the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset. "
1.0,8,text_content,"Paul’s mother answered in her soft contralto: ‘The Atreides are known to start late getting their growth, Your Reverence.’ "
1.0,9,text_content,"‘So I’ve heard, so I’ve heard,’ wheezed the old woman. ‘Yet he’s already fifteen.’ "
1.0,10,text_content,"‘Yes, Your Reverence.’ "
1.0,11,text_content,And if he’s really the Kwisatz Haderach … well …’ 
1.0,12,text_content,seemed to expand and glow as they stared into his. 
1.0,13,text_content,"‘Sleep well, you sly little rascal,’ said the old woman. ‘Tomorrow you’ll need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar.’ "
1.0,14,text_content,"And she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid thump. "
1.0,15,text_content,Paul lay awake wondering: ‘What’s a gom jabbar?’ 
1.0,16,text_content,"In all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest thing he had seen. "
1.0,17,text_content,‘Your Reverence.’ 
1.0,18,text_content,concubine and mother of the ducal heir. 
1.0,19,text_content,‘Is a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there?’ he wondered. 
1.0,20,text_content,He mouthed her strange words: ‘Gom jabbar … Kwisatz Haderach.’ 
1.0,21,text_content,new knowledge. ‘Arrakis – Dune – Desert Planet.’ 
1.0,22,text_content,the Landsraad. 
1.0,23,text_content,"‘A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,’ Hawat had said. "
1.0,24,text_content,‘Arrakis – Dune – Desert Planet.’ 
1.0,25,text_content,"the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions. "
1.0,26,text_content,The dream faded. 
1.0,27,text_content,"bashar to command them: will-o’-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate. "
1.0,28,text_content,‘Arrakis – Dune – Desert Planet.’ 
1.0,29,text_content,… strive for flow-permanence within … 
1.0,30,text_content,Over and over and over within Paul’s floating awareness the lesson rolled. 
1.0,31,text_content,"renewed bustle and hurry in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling. "
1.0,32,text_content,"The hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze held with a black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes staring solemnly. "
1.0,33,text_content,"‘You’re awake,’ she said. ‘Did you sleep well?’ "
1.0,34,text_content,‘Yes.’ 
1.0,35,text_content,"She turned, holding a semiformal jacket for him. It carried the red Atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket. "
1.0,36,text_content,"‘Hurry and dress,’ she said. ‘Reverend Mother is waiting.’ "
1.0,37,text_content,"‘I dreamed of her once,’ Paul said. ‘Who is she?’ "
1.0,38,text_content,tell her about your dreams.’ 
1.0,39,text_content,‘I will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?’ 
1.0,40,text_content,keep Reverend Mother waiting.’ 
1.0,41,text_content,"Paul sat up, hugged his knees. ‘What’s a gom jabbar?’ "
1.0,42,text_content,"Again, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible hesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear. "
1.0,43,text_content,"about … the gom jabbar soon enough,’ she said. "
1.0,44,text_content,He heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it. 
1.0,45,text_content,Jessica spoke without turning. ‘Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning room. Please hurry.’ 
1.0,46,text_content,from a Bene Gesserit-with-the-Sight. Even the Padishah Emperor’s Truthsayer couldn’t evade that responsibility when the duty call came. 
1.0,47,text_content,‘Damn that Jessica!’ the Reverend Mother thought. ‘If only she’d borne us a girl as she was ordered to do!’ 
1.0,48,text_content,Paul gave the short bow his dancing master had taught – the one used ‘when in doubt of another’s station.’ 
1.0,49,text_content,"The nuances of Paul’s greeting were not lost on the Reverend Mother. She said: ‘He’s a cautious one, Jessica.’ "
1.0,50,text_content,"under control. ‘Thus he has been taught, Your Reverence.’ "
1.0,51,text_content,‘What does she fear?’ Paul wondered. 
1.0,52,text_content,"green eyes: like the old Duke, the paternal grandfather who is dead. "
1.0,53,text_content,"‘Now, there was a man who appreciated the power of bravura – even in death,’ the Reverend Mother thought. "
1.0,54,text_content,‘Leave us. I enjoin you to practice the meditation of peace.’ 
1.0,55,text_content,"Jessica took her hand from Paul’s shoulder. ‘Your Reverence, I—’ "
1.0,56,text_content,"‘Jessica, you know it must be done.’ "
1.0,57,text_content,"Paul looked up at his mother, puzzled. "
1.0,58,text_content,Jessica straightened. ‘Yes … of course.’ 
1.0,59,text_content,felt an angry apprehension at the fear he sensed radiating from his mother. 
1.0,60,text_content,‘Paul …’ Jessica took a deep breath. ‘… this test you’re about to receive … it’s important to me.’ 
1.0,61,text_content,‘Test?’ He looked up at her. 
1.0,62,text_content,closed solidly behind her. 
1.0,63,text_content,"Paul faced the old woman, holding anger in check. ‘Does one dismiss the Lady Jessica as though she were a serving wench?’ "
1.0,64,text_content,"A smile flicked the corners of the wrinkled old mouth. ‘The Lady Jessica ‘was’ my serving wench, lad, for fourteen years at school.’ She nodded. ‘And a good one, too. Now, ‘you’ come here!’ "
1.0,65,text_content,"The command whipped out at him. Paul found himself obeying before he could think about it. ‘Using the Voice on me,’ he thought. He stopped at her gesture, standing beside her knees. "
1.0,66,text_content,it and Paul saw that one side was open – black and oddly frightening. No light penetrated that open blackness. 
1.0,67,text_content,"‘Put your right hand in the box,’ she said. "
1.0,68,text_content,"Fear shot through Paul. He started to back away, but the old woman said: ‘Is this how you obey your mother?’ "
1.0,69,text_content,He looked up into bird-bright eyes. 
1.0,70,text_content,"as the blackness closed around his hand, then slick metal against his fingers and a prickling as though his hand were asleep. "
1.0,71,text_content,the side of Paul’s neck. He saw a glint of metal there and started to turn toward it. 
1.0,72,text_content,‘Stop!’ she snapped. 
1.0,73,text_content,‘Using the Voice again!’ He swung his attention back to her face. 
1.0,74,text_content,on its tip. Ah-ah! Don’t pull away or you’ll feel that poison.’ 
1.0,75,text_content,pale gums around silvery metal teeth that flashed as she spoke. 
1.0,76,text_content,and the ones in between. Here’s a new one for you: the gom jabbar. It kills only animals.’ 
1.0,77,text_content,Pride overcame Paul’s fear. ‘You dare suggest a duke’s son is an animal?’ he demanded. 
1.0,78,text_content,drive this needle into your neck before you escape me.’ 
1.0,79,text_content,‘Who are you?’ he whispered. ‘How did you trick my mother into leaving me alone with you? Are you from the Harkonnens?’ 
1.0,80,text_content,away. 
1.0,81,text_content,you die. This is the only rule. Keep your hand in the box and live. Withdraw it and die.’ 
1.0,82,text_content,Paul took a deep breath to still his trembling. ‘If I call out there’ll be servants on you in seconds ‘and you’ll’ die.’ 
1.0,83,text_content,it’s your turn. Be honored. We seldom administer this to men-children.’ 
1.0,84,text_content,Bene Gesserit rite. 
1.0,85,text_content,the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.’’ 
1.0,86,text_content,"He felt calmness return, said: ‘Get on with it, old woman.’ "
1.0,87,text_content,takes you. Understand?’ 
1.0,88,text_content,‘What’s in the box?’ 
1.0,89,text_content,‘Pain.’ 
1.0,90,text_content,"He felt increased tingling in his hand, pressed his lips tightly together. ‘How could this be a test?’ he wondered. The tingling became an itch. "
1.0,91,text_content,"would remain in the trap, endure the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind.’ "
1.0,92,text_content,The itch became the faintest burning. ‘Why are you doing this?’ he demanded. 
1.0,93,text_content,‘To determine if you’re human. Be silent.’ 
1.0,94,text_content,"burning hand, but couldn’t move them. "
1.0,95,text_content,"‘It burns,’ he whispered. "
1.0,96,text_content,‘Silence!’ 
1.0,97,text_content,"neck. He sensed that he was breathing in gasps, tried to slow his breaths and couldn’t. "
1.0,98,text_content,Pain! 
1.0,99,text_content,"His world emptied of everything except that hand immersed in agony, the ancient face inches away staring at him. "
1.0,100,text_content,His lips were so dry he had difficulty separating them. 
1.0,101,text_content,‘The burning! The burning!’ 
1.0,102,text_content,bones remained. 
1.0,103,text_content,It stopped! 
1.0,104,text_content,"As though a switch had been turned off, the pain stopped. "
1.0,105,text_content,"Paul felt his right arm trembling, felt sweat bathing his body. "
1.0,106,text_content,it.’ 
1.0,107,text_content,of pain inhibited every movement. Reason told him he would withdraw a blackened stump from that box. 
1.0,108,text_content,‘Do it!’ she snapped. 
1.0,109,text_content,"turned it, flexed the fingers. "
1.0,110,text_content,"secret of this box, though.’ She slipped it into the folds of her gown. "
1.0,111,text_content,‘But the pain—’ he said. 
1.0,112,text_content,"‘Pain,’ she sniffed. ‘A human can override any nerve in the body.’ "
1.0,113,text_content,"palm. He dropped the hand to his side, looked at the old woman. ‘You did that to my mother once?’ "
1.0,114,text_content,‘Ever sift sand through a screen?’ she asked. 
1.0,115,text_content,The tangential slash of her question shocked his mind into a higher awareness: ‘Sand through a screen.’ He nodded. 
1.0,116,text_content,‘We Bene Gesserit sift people to find the humans.’ 
1.0,117,text_content,"He lifted his right hand, willing the memory of the pain. ‘And that’s all there is to it – pain?’ "
1.0,118,text_content,the signs of her teaching in you. Our test is crisis and observation.’ 
1.0,119,text_content,"He heard the confirmation in her voice, said: ‘It’s truth!’ "
1.0,120,text_content,"She stared at him. ‘He senses truth! Could he be the one? Could he truly be the one?’ She extinguished the excitement, reminding herself: ‘‘Hope clouds observation.’’ "
1.0,121,text_content,"‘You know when people believe what they say,’ she said. "
1.0,122,text_content,‘I know it.’ 
1.0,123,text_content,"Haderach. Sit down, little brother, here at my feet.’ "
1.0,124,text_content,‘I prefer to stand.’ 
1.0,125,text_content,‘Your mother sat at my feet once.’ 
1.0,126,text_content,‘I’m not my mother.’ 
1.0,127,text_content,"‘You hate us a little, eh?’ She looked toward the door, called out: ‘Jessica!’ "
1.0,128,text_content,managed a faint smile. 
1.0,129,text_content,"‘Jessica, have you ever stopped hating me?’ the old woman asked. "
1.0,130,text_content,"‘I both love and hate you,’Jessica said. ‘The hate – that’s from pains I must never forget. The love – that’s …’ "
1.0,131,text_content,and mind it that no one interrupts us.’ 
1.0,132,text_content,"Jessica stepped into the room, closed the door and stood with her back to it. ‘My son lives,’ she thought. ‘My son lives and is … human. I knew he was … but … he lives. Now, I can go on living.’ The door felt hard and real against her back. Everything in the room was immediate and pressing against her senses. "
1.0,133,text_content,‘My son lives.’ 
1.0,134,text_content,purpose. He did not know yet what the terrible purpose was. 
1.0,135,text_content,"‘Some day, lad,’ the old woman said, ‘you, too, may have to stand outside a door like that. It takes a measure of doing.’ "
1.0,136,text_content,any question he might ask her would bring an answer that could lift him out of his flesh-world into something greater. 
1.0,137,text_content,‘Why do you test for humans?’ he asked. 
1.0,138,text_content,‘To set you free.’ 
1.0,139,text_content,‘Free?’ 
1.0,140,text_content,men with machines to enslave them.’ 
1.0,141,text_content,"‘“Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man’s mind,’” Paul quoted. "
1.0,142,text_content,shalt not make a machine to counterfeit a ‘human’ mind.” Have you studied the Mentat in your service?’ 
1.0,143,text_content,‘I’ve studied ‘with’ Thufir Hawat.’ 
1.0,144,text_content,"‘The Great Revolt took away a crutch,’ she said. ‘It forced ‘human’ minds to develop. Schools were started to train ‘human’ talents.’ "
1.0,145,text_content,‘Bene Gesserit schools?’ 
1.0,146,text_content,"we think, emphasizes almost pure mathematics. Bene Gesserit performs another function.’ "
1.0,147,text_content,"‘Politics,’ he said. "
1.0,148,text_content,‘Kull wahad!’ the old woman said. She sent a hard glance at Jessica. 
1.0,149,text_content,"‘I’ve not told him, Your Reverence,’Jessica said. "
1.0,150,text_content,there could be no such continuity without separating human stock from animal stock – for breeding purposes.’ 
1.0,151,text_content,tied to his terrible purpose. 
1.0,152,text_content,He said: ‘But my mother tells me many Bene Gesserit of the schools don’t know their ancestry.’ 
1.0,153,text_content,her stock was acceptable in itself.’ 
1.0,154,text_content,‘Then why couldn’t she know who her parents are?’ 
1.0,155,text_content,trait. We have many reasons.’ 
1.0,156,text_content,"Again, Paul felt the offense against rightness. He said: ‘You take a lot on yourselves.’ "
1.0,157,text_content,"The Reverend Mother stared at him, wondering: ‘Did I hear criticism in his voice?’ ‘We carry a heavy burden,’ she said. "
1.0,158,text_content,"I’m the … Kwisatz Haderach. What’s that, a human gom jabbar?’ "
1.0,159,text_content,"‘Paul,’Jessica said. ‘You mustn’t take that tone with—’ "
1.0,160,text_content,"‘I’ll handle this, Jessica,’ the old woman said. ‘Now, lad, do you know about the Truthsayer drug?’ "
1.0,161,text_content,"‘You take it to improve your ability to detect falsehood,’ he said. ‘My mother’s told me.’ "
1.0,162,text_content,‘Have you ever seen truthtrance?’ 
1.0,163,text_content,He shook his head. ‘No.’ 
1.0,164,text_content,will come one day and find in the gift of the drug his inward eye. He will look where we cannot – into both feminine and masculine pasts.’ 
1.0,165,text_content,‘Your Kwisatz Haderach?’ 
1.0,166,text_content,"‘Yes, the one who can be many places at once: the Kwisatz Haderach. Many men have tried the drug … so many, but none has succeeded.’ "
1.0,167,text_content,"‘They tried and failed, all of them?’ "
1.0,168,text_content,"‘Oh, no.’ She shook her head. ‘They tried and died.’ "
2.0,1,opening_text,without knowing Falsehood. It is the attempt to see the Light without knowing Darkness. It cannot be. 
2.0,2,opening_caption,—from ‘Manual of Muad’Dib’ by the Princess Irulan 
2.0,3,text_content,"filmbooks, tapes and reels. Light glowed in the room from golden balls hanging in mobile suspensor fields. "
2.0,4,text_content,"The other held a slender, short man with effeminate face. "
2.0,5,text_content,Both youth and man stared at the globe and the man half-hidden in shadows spinning it. 
2.0,6,text_content,"all history. And the Duke’s headed into its jaws. Is it not a magnificent thing that I, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, do?’ "
2.0,7,text_content,"Assuredly, Baron,’ said the man. His voice came out tenor with a sweet musical quality. "
2.0,8,text_content,insets of finest cloud-milk diamonds. 
2.0,9,text_content,lovely polar caps – so small. Could anyone mistake this place? Arrakis! Truly unique. A superb setting for a unique victory.’ 
2.0,10,text_content,poignant.’ 
2.0,11,text_content,confuse my nephew.’ 
2.0,12,text_content,tapping sounded at the door in the wall behind him. 
2.0,13,text_content,unrolled the cylinder and scanned it. A chuckle sounded from him. Another. 
2.0,14,text_content,‘Well?’ the Baron demanded. 
2.0,15,text_content,"‘The fool answered us, Baron!’ "
2.0,16,text_content,"‘Whenever did an Atreides refuse the opportunity for a gesture?’ the Baron asked. ‘Well, what does he say?’ "
2.0,17,text_content,"‘He’s most uncouth, Baron. Addresses you as “Harkonnen” – no “Sire et Cher Cousin,” no title, nothing.’ "
2.0,18,text_content,"‘It’s a good name,’ the Baron growled, and his voice betrayed his impatience. ‘What does dear Leto say?’ "
2.0,19,text_content,‘He says: “Your offer of a meeting is refused. I have ofttimes met your treachery and this all men know.”’ 
2.0,20,text_content,‘And?’ the Baron asked. 
2.0,21,text_content,"‘Of Arrakis! Oh, my! This is almost too rich!’ "
2.0,22,text_content,"‘Vendetta, heh? And he uses the nice old word so rich in tradition to be sure I know he means it.’ "
2.0,23,text_content,"‘You made the peace gesture,’ Piter said. ‘The forms have been obeyed.’ "
2.0,24,text_content,"eyes, the shaded slits of blue within blue, the eyes without any white in them at all. "
2.0,25,text_content,been more beautiful. It is to see a plan of the most exquisite treachery: to ‘make’ Leto exchange Caladan for Dune – and without alternative because the Emperor orders it. How waggish of you!’ 
2.0,26,text_content,"In a cold voice, the Baron said: ‘You have a flux of the mouth, Piter.’ "
2.0,27,text_content,"‘But I am happy, my Baron. Whereas you … you are touched by jealousy.’ "
2.0,28,text_content,‘Piter!’ 
2.0,29,text_content,"‘Ah-ah, Baron! Is it not regrettable you were unable to devise this delicious scheme by yourself?’ "
2.0,30,text_content,"‘Someday I will have you strangled, Piter.’ "
2.0,31,text_content,"‘Of a certainty, Baron. Enfin! But a kind act is never lost, eh?’ "
2.0,32,text_content,"‘Have you been chewing verite or semuta, Piter?’ "
2.0,33,text_content,"not. True, Baron?’ "
2.0,34,text_content,The Baron continued to stare at Piter. 
2.0,35,text_content,Feyd-Rautha squirmed in his chair. ‘These wrangling fools!’ he thought. ‘My uncle cannot talk to his Mentat without arguing. Do they think I’ve nothing to do except listen to their arguments?’ 
2.0,36,text_content,"‘Feyd,’ the Baron said. ‘I told you to listen and learn when I invited you in here. Are you learning?’ "
2.0,37,text_content,"‘Yes, Uncle.’ The voice was carefully subservient. "
2.0,38,text_content,all the Atreides. But surely Leto will know whose hand directed the pliant doctor … and knowing that will be a terrible thing.’ 
2.0,39,text_content,"of pity, but—’ "
2.0,40,text_content,"I’ll gain a bit more room to maneuver. The necessity is obvious, but I don’t have to like it.’ "
2.0,41,text_content,will send a legion or two of his Sardaukar down here onto Giedi Prime and that’ll be an end to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.’ 
2.0,42,text_content,my cities and sack this castle. You’d truly enjoy that.’ 
2.0,43,text_content,‘Does the Baron need to ask?’ Piter whispered. 
2.0,44,text_content,with my promise of the spoils of Arrakis.’ 
2.0,45,text_content,"in the room, and the youth looked up at Piter with a worried frown. "
2.0,46,text_content,"‘Do not toy with Piter, Baron,’ Piter said. ‘You promised me the Lady Jessica. You promised her to me.’ "
2.0,47,text_content,"‘For what, Piter?’ the Baron asked. ‘For pain?’ "
2.0,48,text_content,"Piter stared at him, dragging out the silence. "
2.0,49,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha moved his suspensor chair to one side, said: ‘Uncle, do I have to stay? You said you’d—’ "
2.0,50,text_content,"And he turned his attention back to the Mentat. ‘What of the Dukeling, the child Paul, my dear Piter?’ "
2.0,51,text_content,"‘The trap will bring him to you, Baron,’ Piter muttered. "
2.0,52,text_content,"to the Duke. You were wrong, eh, Mentat?’ "
2.0,53,text_content,wrong. And you know yourself these Bene Gesserit bear mostly daughters. Even the Emperor’s consort has produced only females.’ 
2.0,54,text_content,"‘Uncle,’ said Feyd-Rautha, ‘you said there’d be something important here for me to—’ "
2.0,55,text_content,Have you observed our good Mentat? You should’ve learned something from this exchange.’ 
2.0,56,text_content,"‘But, Uncle—’ "
2.0,57,text_content,"‘A most efficient Mentat, Piter, wouldn’t you say, Feyd?’ "
2.0,58,text_content,"‘Yes, but—’ "
2.0,59,text_content,"Efficient, Piter, ‘but’ he’s still emotional and prone to passionate outbursts. Efficient, Piter, ‘but’ he still can err.’ "
2.0,60,text_content,"Piter spoke in a low, sullen tone: ‘Did you call me in here to impair my efficiency with criticism, Baron?’ "
2.0,61,text_content,"‘Impair your efficiency? You know me better, Piter. I wish only for my nephew to understand the limitations of a Mentat.’ "
2.0,62,text_content,‘Are you already training my replacement?’ Piter demanded. 
2.0,63,text_content,"‘Replace ‘you?’ Why, Piter, where could I find another Mentat with your cunning and venom?’ "
2.0,64,text_content,"‘The same place you found me, Baron.’ "
2.0,65,text_content,"‘Perhaps I should at that,’ the Baron mused. ‘You do seem a bit unstable lately. And the spice you eat!’ "
2.0,66,text_content,"‘Are my pleasures too expensive, Baron? Do you object to them?’ "
2.0,67,text_content,about you.’ 
2.0,68,text_content,"‘Then I’m on display,’ Piter said. ‘Shall I dance? Shall I perform my various functions for the eminent Feyd-Rau—’ "
2.0,69,text_content,"be overlooked. A serious drawback, that. I sometimes think the ancients with their thinking machines had the right idea.’ "
2.0,70,text_content,"‘They were toys compared to me,’ Piter snarled. ‘You yourself, Baron, could outperform those ‘machines.’’ "
2.0,71,text_content,"of our campaign against the House of Atreides. Function as a Mentat for us, if you please.’ "
2.0,72,text_content,"‘Baron, I’ve warned you not to trust one so young with this information. My observations of—’ "
2.0,73,text_content,"‘I’ll be the judge of this,’ the Baron said. ‘I give you an order, Mentat. Perform one of your various functions.’ "
2.0,74,text_content,"Hawat, will have concluded rightly that Arrakeen is easier to defend.’ "
2.0,75,text_content,"‘Listen carefully, Feyd,’ the Baron said. ‘Observe the plans within plans within plans.’ "
2.0,76,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha nodded, thinking: ‘This is more like it. The old monster is letting me in on secret things at last. He must really mean for me to be his heir.’ "
2.0,77,text_content,"Others in like circumstances have become renegade Houses, taking family atomics and shields and fleeing beyond the Imperium.’ "
2.0,78,text_content,"‘The Duke’s too proud a man for that,’ the Baron said. "
2.0,79,text_content,"‘It is a possibility,’ Piter said. ‘The ultimate effect for us would be the same, however.’ "
2.0,80,text_content,"‘No, it would not!’ the Baron growled. ‘I must have him dead and his line ended.’ "

2.0,82,text_content,"‘So,’ the Baron sighed. ‘Get on with it, Piter.’ "
2.0,83,text_content,"‘At Arrakeen,’ Piter said, ‘the Duke and his family will occupy the Residency, lately the home of Count and Lady Fenring.’ "
2.0,84,text_content,"‘The Ambassador to the Smugglers,’ the Baron chuckled. "
2.0,85,text_content,‘Ambassador to what?’ Feyd-Rautha asked. 
2.0,86,text_content,in smuggling operations on Arrakis.’ 
2.0,87,text_content,Feyd-Rautha turned a puzzled stare on his uncle. ‘Why?’ 
2.0,88,text_content,be otherwise? How else could spies and assassins move about?’ 
2.0,89,text_content,Feyd-Rautha’s mouth made a soundless ‘Oh-h-h-h.’ 
2.0,90,text_content,which could succeed.’ 
2.0,91,text_content,"‘Piter,’ the Baron rumbled, ‘you indicated—’ "
2.0,92,text_content,"‘I indicated accidents can happen,’ Piter said. ‘And the attempt must appear valid.’ "
2.0,93,text_content,"… with that witch mother training him. Accursed woman! Ah, well, please continue, Piter.’ "
2.0,94,text_content,We found the lever that moved the doctor.’ 
2.0,95,text_content,‘How?’ Feyd-Rautha asked. He found this a fascinating subject. ‘Everyone’ knew you couldn’t subvert Imperial Conditioning! 
2.0,96,text_content,"‘Another time,’ the Baron said. ‘Continue, Piter.’ "
2.0,97,text_content,will recommend her to Hawat’s attention.’ 
2.0,98,text_content,‘Her?’ Feyd-Rautha asked. 
2.0,99,text_content,"‘The Lady Jessica herself,’ the Baron said. "
2.0,100,text_content,"He may even try to kill her.’ Piter frowned, then: ‘But I don’t think he’ll be able to carry it off.’ "
2.0,101,text_content,"‘You don’t want him to, eh?’ the Baron asked. "
2.0,102,text_content,"when the moment is ripe, we’ll signal Yueh and move in with our major force … ah …’ "
2.0,103,text_content,"‘Go ahead, tell him all of it,’ the Baron said. "

2.0,112,text_content,"‘You do not drool very prettily, Baron,’ Piter said. "
2.0,113,text_content,"‘Get on with it, I command you!’ the Baron roared. "
2.0,114,text_content,Your uncle will have dispensation of that fief. His own ‘personal’ agent will rule on Arrakis.’ 
2.0,115,text_content,"‘More profits,’ Feyd-Rautha said. "

3.0,7,text_content,"‘Poor Paul,’ she whispered. "
3.0,8,text_content,"‘I asked you a question, Jessica!’ The old woman’s voice was snappish, demanding. "
3.0,9,text_content,between the two west windows. ‘What do you want me to say?’ 
3.0,10,text_content,‘What do I want you to say? What do I want you to say?’ The old voice carried a tone of cruel mimicry. 
3.0,11,text_content,‘So I had a son!’Jessica flared. And she knew she was being goaded into this anger deliberately. 
3.0,12,text_content,‘You were told to bear only daughters to the Atreides.’ 
3.0,13,text_content,"‘It meant so much to him,’Jessica pleaded. "
3.0,14,text_content,‘And you in your pride thought you could produce the Kwisatz Haderach!’ 
3.0,15,text_content,Jessica lifted her chin. ‘I sensed the possibility.’ 
3.0,16,text_content,bloodlines now.’ 
3.0,17,text_content,"You’re not infallible,’Jessica said. She braved the steady stare from the old eyes. "
3.0,18,text_content,"Presently, the old woman muttered: ‘What’s done is done.’ "
3.0,19,text_content,"‘I vowed never to regret my decision,’Jessica said. "
3.0,20,text_content,man’s hand turned against you to seek your life and the life of your son.’ 
3.0,21,text_content,Jessica paled. ‘Is there no alternative?’ 
3.0,22,text_content,‘Alternative? A Bene Gesserit should ask that?’ 
3.0,23,text_content,‘I ask only what you see in the future with your superior abilities.’ 
3.0,24,text_content,"The Imperium, the CHOAM Company, all the Great Houses, they are but bits of flotsam in the path of the flood.’ "
3.0,25,text_content,"‘CHOAM,’Jessica muttered. ‘I suppose it’s already decided how they’ll redivide the spoils of Arrakis.’ "
3.0,26,text_content,"same profits his voting strength will increase. This is the pattern of history, girl.’ "
3.0,27,text_content,"‘That’s certainly what I need right now,’ Jessica said. ‘A review of history.’ "

3.0,35,text_content,‘I’ll shield him as well as I’m able.’ 
3.0,36,text_content,strong enough to fulfill ‘any’ destiny.’ 
3.0,37,text_content,"Jessica turned away, looked out the window at the gathering darkness. ‘Is it really that terrible, this planet of Arrakis?’ "
3.0,38,text_content,"heaved herself to her feet, straightened a fold in her gown. ‘Call the boy in here. I must be leaving soon.’ "
3.0,39,text_content,‘Must you?’

3.0,47,text_content,"Jessica nodded, went to the door of the Meditation Chamber, opened it. ‘Paul, come in now, please.’ "
3.0,48,text_content,door behind him. 
3.0,49,text_content,"‘Young man,’ the old woman said, ‘let’s return to this dream business.’ "
3.0,50,text_content,‘What do you want?’ he asked. 
3.0,51,text_content,‘Do you dream every night?’ 
3.0,52,text_content,"‘Not dreams worth remembering. I can remember every dream, but some are worth remembering and some aren’t.’ "
3.0,53,text_content,‘How do you know the difference?’ 
3.0,54,text_content,‘I just know it.’ 
3.0,55,text_content,"The old woman glanced at Jessica, back to Paul. ‘What did you dream last night? Was it worth remembering?’ "
3.0,56,text_content,his eyes. 
3.0,57,text_content,"‘And the thing you tell this strange girl about seeing me, did it happen today?’ "
3.0,58,text_content,"Paul thought about this, then: Yes. I tell the girl you came and put a stamp of strangeness on me.’ "
3.0,59,text_content,"me truly now, Paul, do you often have dreams of things that happen afterward exactly as you dreamed them?’ "
3.0,60,text_content,‘Yes. And I’ve dreamed about that girl before.’ 
3.0,61,text_content,‘Oh? You know her?’ 
3.0,62,text_content,‘I will know her.’ 
3.0,63,text_content,Tell me about her.’ 
3.0,64,text_content,Usul.” ’ Paul opened his eyes. ‘Isn’t that strange? My home-world’s Caladan. I’ve never even heard of a planet called Usul.’ 
3.0,65,text_content,‘Is there more to this dream?’Jessica prompted. 
3.0,66,text_content,some of the words – like beach and surf and seaweed and seagulls.’ 
3.0,67,text_content,‘What poem?’ the Reverend Mother asked. 
3.0,68,text_content,Paul opened his eyes. ‘It’s just one of Gurney Halleck’s tone poems for sad times.’ 
3.0,69,text_content,"Behind Paul, Jessica began to recite: "
3.0,70,text_poem,‘I remember salt smoke from a beach fire. 
3.0,71,text_poem,And shadows under the pines— 
3.0,72,text_poem,"Solid, clean … fixed— "
3.0,73,text_poem,"Seagulls perched at the tip of land, "
3.0,74,text_poem,White upon green …

3.0,77,text_poem,"The seagulls spread their wings, "
3.0,78,text_poem,Lift 
3.0,79,text_poem,And fill the sky with screeches. 
3.0,80,text_poem,And I hear the wind 
3.0,81,text_poem,"Blowing across our beach, "
3.0,82,text_poem,"And the surf, "
3.0,83,text_poem,And I see that our fire 
3.0,84,text_poem,Has scorched the seaweed.’ 
3.0,85,text_content,"‘That’s the one,’ Paul said "
3.0,86,text_content,"I see, too, but no more.’ "
3.0,87,text_content,She fell silent and Paul saw that she wanted him to speak. He waited her out. 
3.0,88,text_content,"Presently, she said: ‘As you will, then. You’ve depths in you; that I’ll grant.’ "
3.0,89,text_content,‘May I go now?’ he asked. 
3.0,90,text_content,‘Don’t you want to hear what the Reverend Mother can tell you about the Kwisatz Haderach?’Jessica asked. 
3.0,91,text_content,‘She said those who tried for it died.’ 
3.0,92,text_content,"‘But I can help you with a few hints at why they failed,’ the Reverend Mother said. "
3.0,93,text_content,"‘She talks of hints,’ Paul thought. ‘She doesn’t really know anything.’ And he said: ‘Hint then.’ "
3.0,94,text_content,"‘And be damned to me?’ She smiled wryly, a crisscross of wrinkles in the old face. ‘Very well: “That which submits rules.”’ "
3.0,95,text_content,taught him nothing at all? 
3.0,96,text_content,‘That’s a hint?’ he asked. 
3.0,97,text_content,until one day it is many willows – a wall against the wind. This is the willow’s purpose.’

3.0,100,text_content,"but possible. But for your father, nothing. When you’ve learned to accept that as a fact, you’ve learned a ‘real’ Bene Gesserit lesson.’ "
3.0,101,text_content,made her so sure? His mind seethed with resentment. 
3.0,102,text_content,same in your shoes and devil take the Rules.’ 
3.0,103,text_content,Jessica nodded. 
3.0,104,text_content,"But if you don’t – well, we shall yet succeed.’ "
3.0,105,text_content,"her robes hissing, with not another backward glance. The room and its occupants already were shut from her thoughts. "
3.0,106,text_content,The tears were more unnerving than any other word or sign that had passed between them this day.

4.0,5,text_content,"the door, intent on papers and charts spread across an ell table. "
4.0,6,text_content,‘How many times must I tell that lad never to settle himself with his back to a door?’ Hawat cleared his throat. 
4.0,7,text_content,Paul remained bent over his studies. 
4.0,8,text_content,"A cloud shadow passed over the skylights. Again, Hawat cleared his throat. "
4.0,9,text_content,"Paul straightened, spoke without turning: ‘I know. I’m sitting with my back to a door.’ "
4.0,10,text_content,"Hawat suppressed a smile, strode across the room. "
4.0,11,text_content,dark and deeply seamed face. 
4.0,12,text_content,"‘I heard you coming down the hall,’ Paul said. ‘And I heard you open the door.’ "
4.0,13,text_content,‘The sounds I make could be imitated.’ 
4.0,14,text_content,‘I’d know the difference.’ 
4.0,15,text_content,that’s why they sent the old Proctor here – to whip our dear Lady Jessica into line.’ 
4.0,16,text_content,like an ancient foot soldier maimed and battered in the wars. 
4.0,17,text_content,"‘There stand I,’ Hawat thought. "
4.0,18,text_content,"‘Thufir, what’re you thinking?’ Paul asked. "
4.0,19,text_content,Hawat looked at the boy. ‘I was thinking we’ll all be out of here soon and likely never see the place again.’ 
4.0,20,text_content,‘Does that make you sad?’ 
4.0,21,text_content,is just another place.’ 
4.0,22,text_content,‘Did my father send you up to test me?’ 
4.0,23,text_content,"himself, but you must know how busy he is. He’ll be along later.’ "
4.0,24,text_content,‘I’ve been studying about the storms on Arrakis.’ 
4.0,25,text_content,‘The storms. I see.’ 
4.0,26,text_content,‘They sound pretty bad.’ 
4.0,27,text_content,bones to slivers.’ 
4.0,28,text_content,‘Why don’t they have weather control?’ 
4.0,29,text_content,"price for satellite control and your father’s House isn’t one of the big rich ones, lad. You know that.’ "
4.0,30,text_content,‘Have you ever seen the Fremen?’ 
4.0,31,text_content,"‘The lad’s mind is darting all over today,’ Hawat thought. "
4.0,32,text_content,– that reclaim the body’s own water.’ 
4.0,33,text_content,"water they had to recycle their body moisture struck him with a feeling of desolation. ‘Water’s precious there,’ he said. "

4.0,38,text_content,wind and hidden from view. You’ll ride upon your own two feet without ’thopter or groundcar or mount.’ 
4.0,39,text_content,And Paul had been caught more by her tone – singsong and wavering – than by her words. 
4.0,40,text_content,"‘When you live upon Arrakis,’ she had said, ‘khala, the land is empty. The moons will be your friends, the sun your enemy.’ "
4.0,41,text_content,"and asked: ‘Do you see no hope, Your Reverence?’ "
4.0,42,text_content,into a fist. ‘… without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make ‘that’ the science of your tradition!’ 
4.0,43,text_content,"sitting in the training room with Thufir Hawat, Paul felt a sharp pang of fear. He looked across at the Mentat’s puzzled frown. "
4.0,44,text_content,‘Where were you woolgathering that time?’ Hawat asked. 
4.0,45,text_content,‘Did you meet the Reverend Mother?’ 
4.0,46,text_content,‘That Truthsayer witch from the Imperium?’ Hawat’s eyes quickened with interest. ‘I met her.’ 
4.0,47,text_content,"‘She …’ Paul hesitated, found that he couldn’t tell Hawat about the ordeal. The inhibitions went deep. "
4.0,48,text_content,‘Yes? What did she?’ 
4.0,49,text_content,"but she said he’d already been warned – by you, by Mother, by many people.’ "
4.0,50,text_content,"‘True enough,’ Hawat muttered. "
4.0,51,text_content,‘Then why’re we going?’ Paul demanded. 
4.0,52,text_content,ancient fountain of wisdom?’ 
4.0,53,text_content,"Paul looked down at his right hand clenched into a fist beneath the table. Slowly, he willed the muscles to relax. ‘She put some kind of hold on me,’ he thought. ‘How?’ "
4.0,54,text_content,to do.’ 
4.0,55,text_content,"‘She hit a mark there right enough,’ Hawat thought. He nodded for Paul to continue. "
4.0,56,text_content,men.’ 
4.0,57,text_content,‘How’d she figure your father attracted men like Duncan and Gurney?’ Hawat asked. 
4.0,58,text_content,of Life.’ 
4.0,59,text_content,Hawat chuckled. ‘How’d that sit with her?’ 
4.0,60,text_content,must join it and flow with it.” That seemed to satisfy her.’ 
4.0,61,text_content,"‘He seems to be getting over it,’ Hawat thought, ‘but that old witch frightened him. Why did she do it?’ "
4.0,62,text_content,"‘Thufir,’ Paul said, ‘will Arrakis be as bad as she said?’ "
4.0,63,text_content,"You must not breathe a word of this, lad. I tell you only as your father’s helper.’ "
4.0,64,text_content,"as bad, but much like it.’ "
4.0,65,text_content,– you’re right on that score.’ 
4.0,66,text_content,‘Will the Fremen help us?’ 
4.0,67,text_content,the castle; it’s just a habit I want you to form.’ 
4.0,68,text_content,"Paul got to his feet, moved around the table. ‘You’re going today?’ "
4.0,69,text_content,"shoulder, whirled and strode quickly to the door. "
4.0,70,text_content,‘Thufir!’ Paul called. 
4.0,71,text_content,"Hawat turned, standing in the open doorway. "
4.0,72,text_content,"‘Don’t sit with your back to any doors,’ Paul said. "
4.0,73,text_content,"A grin spread across the seamed old face. ‘That I won’t, lad. Depend on it.’ And he was gone, shutting the door softly behind. "
4.0,74,text_content,"had said about a world being the sum of many things – the people, the dirt, the growing things, the moons, the tides, the suns – the unknown sum called ‘nature,’ a vague summation without any sense of the ‘now.’ And he wondered: ‘What is the now?’ "
4.0,75,text_content,The door across from Paul banged open and an ugly lump of a man lurched through it preceded by a handful of weapons. 
4.0,76,text_content,"‘Well, Gurney Halleck,’ Paul called, ‘are you the new weapons master?’ "
4.0,77,text_content,around. 
4.0,78,text_content,the nine-string baliset slung over Gurney’s shoulder with the multi-pick woven through the strings near the head of the fingerboard. 
4.0,79,text_content,"stunners, the shield belts. The inkvine scar along his jawline writhed as he turned, casting a smile across the room. "
4.0,80,text_content,passed me in the hall like a man running to his enemy’s funeral.’ 
4.0,81,text_content,"Paul grinned. Of all his father’s men, he liked Gurney Halleck best, knew the man’s moods and deviltry, his ‘humors,’ and thought of him more as a friend than as a hired sword. "
4.0,82,text_content,"Halleck swung the baliset off his shoulder, began tuning it. ‘If y’ won’t talk, y’ won’t,’ he said. "
4.0,83,text_content,"Paul stood, advanced across the room, calling out: ‘Well, Gurney, do we come prepared for music when it’s fighting time?’ "
4.0,84,text_content,"‘So it’s sass for our elders today,’ Halleck said. He tried a chord on the instrument, nodded. "
4.0,85,text_content,‘Where’s Duncan Idaho?’ Paul asked. ‘Isn’t he supposed to be teaching me weaponry?’ 
4.0,86,text_content,so’s you won’t waste your life entire.’ 
4.0,87,text_content,"‘Maybe you’d better sing me a lay then,’ Paul said. ‘I want to be sure how ‘not’ to do it.’ "
4.0,88,text_content,"‘Ah-h-h, hah!’ Gurney laughed, and he swung into Galacian Girls, his multipick a blur over the strings as he sang: "
4.0,89,text_poem,"‘Oh-h-h, the Galacian girls "
4.0,90,text_poem,"Will do it for pearls, "
4.0,91,text_poem,And the Arrakeen for water!

4.0,97,text_content,"it fast around his waist. ‘Then, let’s fight!’ "
4.0,98,text_content,"– guard yourself.’ He grabbed up a rapier, laced the air with it. ‘I’m a hellfiend out for revenge!’ "
4.0,99,text_content,"Paul lifted the companion rapier, bent it in his hands, stood in the ‘aguile,’ one foot forward. He let his manner go solemn in a comic imitation of Dr Yueh. "
4.0,100,text_content,to enter a shield’s mindless defenses. 
4.0,101,text_content,‘But you were wide open for an underhanded counter with a slip-tip.’ 
4.0,102,text_content,"Paul stepped back, chagrined. "
4.0,103,text_content,even in play do you let a man inside your guard with death in his hand.’ 
4.0,104,text_content,"‘I guess I’m not in the mood for it today,’ Paul said. "
4.0,105,text_content,the baliset. It’s not for fighting.’ 
4.0,106,text_content,"‘I’m sorry, Gurney.’ "
4.0,107,text_content,‘You’re not sorry enough!’ 
4.0,108,text_content,"I say guard yourself for true!’ He leaped high to one side, then forward, pressing a furious attack. "
4.0,109,text_content,"tingling of the contact along his skin. ‘What’s gotten into Gurney?’ he asked himself. ‘He’s not faking this!’ Paul moved his left hand, dropped his bodkin into his palm from its wrist sheath. "
4.0,110,text_content,"‘You see a need for an extra blade, eh?’ Halleck grunted. "
4.0,111,text_content,‘Is this betrayal?’ Paul wondered. ‘Surely not Gurney!’ 
4.0,112,text_content,of ozone grew stronger. 
4.0,113,text_content,"Paul continued to back, but now he directed his retreat toward the exercise table. ‘If I can turn him beside the table, I’ll show him a trick,’ Paul thought. ‘One more step, Gurney.’ "
4.0,114,text_content,Halleck took the step. 
4.0,115,text_content,high with rapier and came in across Halleck’s neckline with the bodkin. He stopped the blade an inch from the jugular. 
4.0,116,text_content,‘Is this what you seek?’ Paul whispered. 
4.0,117,text_content,"‘Look down, lad,’ Gurney panted. "
4.0,118,text_content,"Paul obeyed, saw Halleck’s kindjal thrust under the table’s edge, the tip almost touching Paul’s groin. "
4.0,119,text_content,"to get the ‘mood.’’ And he grinned wolfishly, the inkvine scar rippling along his jaw. "
4.0,120,text_content,"‘The way you came at me,’ Paul said. ‘Would you really have drawn my blood?’ "
4.0,121,text_content,"one, a scar you’d remember. I’ll not have my favorite pupil fall to the first Harkonnen tramp who happens along.’ "
4.0,122,text_content,father if you’d hurt me. I’ll not have you punished for my failing.’ 
4.0,123,text_content,I’d have been failing there if I hadn’t explained the fallacy in this ‘mood’ thing you’ve suddenly developed.’ 
4.0,124,text_content,"Paul straightened, slipped his bodkin back into its wrist sheath. "
4.0,125,text_content,"‘It’s not exactly play we do here,’ Halleck said. "
4.0,126,text_content,inflicted by a Reverend Mother. He thrust this thought aside; it chilled their world. 
4.0,127,text_content,"‘I guess I did hope for some play today,’ Paul said. ‘Things are so serious around here lately.’ "

4.0,130,text_content,longer can be play. Tomorrow we go to Arrakis. Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.’ 
4.0,131,text_content,Paul touched his forehead with his rapier blade held vertical. 
4.0,132,text_content,And I warn you I’ll be trying new counters today. There’s a warning you’d not get from a real enemy.’ 
4.0,133,text_content,field forcing his blade away. 
4.0,134,text_content,"‘En garde!’ Halleck called, and the dummy pressed the attack. "
4.0,135,text_content,"Paul activated his shield, parried and countered. "
4.0,136,text_content,"Halleck watched as he manipulated the controls. His mind seemed to be in two parts: one alert to the needs of the training fight, and the other wandering in fly-buzz. "
4.0,137,text_content,"‘I’m the well-trained fruit tree,’ he thought. ‘Full of well-trained feelings and abilities and all of them grafted onto me – all bearing for someone else to pick.’ "
4.0,138,text_content,remember. 
4.0,139,text_content,"Paul countered a slow swing of the dummy, brought up his left hand ‘entretisser.’ "
4.0,140,text_content,"‘That clever little devil!’ Halleck thought, intent now on Paul’s interweaving hand motions. ‘He’s been practicing and studying on his own. That’s not Duncan’s style, and it’s certainty nothing I’ve taught him.’ "
4.0,141,text_content,"This thought only added to Halleck’s sadness. ‘I’m infected by mood,’ he thought. And he began to wonder about Paul, if the boy ever listened fearfully to his pillow throbbing in the night. "
4.0,142,text_content,"‘If wishes were fishes we’d all cast nets,’ he murmured. "

5.0,6,text_content,"‘You’ll be happy to hear we haven’t time for regular lessons today,’ Yueh said. ‘Your father will be along presently.’ "
5.0,7,text_content,Paul sat up. 
5.0,8,text_content,"‘However, I’ve arranged for you to have a filmbook viewer and several lessons during the crossing to Arrakis.’ "
5.0,9,text_content,‘Oh.’ 
5.0,10,text_content,since the Emperor’s command to take over the fief of Arrakis. 
5.0,11,text_content,"Yueh crossed to the ell table, thinking: ‘How the boy has filled out these past few months. Such a waste! Oh, such a sad waste.’ And he reminded himself: ‘I must not falter. What I do is done to be certain my Wanna no longer can be hurt by the Harkonnen beasts.’ "
5.0,12,text_content,"Paul joined him at the table, buttoning his jacket. ‘What’ll I be studying on the way across?’ "
5.0,13,text_content,not clear how. I must seek out the planetary ecologist when we arrive – a Dr Kynes – and offer my help in the investigation.’ 
5.0,14,text_content,And Yueh thought: ‘What am I saying? I play the hypocrite even with myself.’ 
5.0,15,text_content,‘Will there be something on the Fremen?’ Paul asked. 
5.0,16,text_content,"‘The Fremen?’ Yueh drummed his fingers on the table, caught Paul staring at the nervous motion, withdrew his hand. "
5.0,17,text_content,"‘Maybe you have something on the whole Arrakeen population,’ Paul said. "
5.0,18,text_content,prefer Fremen husbands; their men prefer Fremen wives. They have a saying: “Polish comes from the cities; wisdom from the desert.”’ 
5.0,19,text_content,‘Do you have pictures of them?’ 
5.0,20,text_content,"‘I’ll see what I can get you. The most interesting feature, of course, is their eyes – totally blue, no whites in them.’ "

5.0,22,text_content,‘No; it’s linked to saturation of the blood with melange.’

5.0,24,text_content,"are violent and dangerous. You’ll not be permitted to mingle with them, I daresay.’ "
5.0,25,text_content,"Paul stared at Yueh, finding in these few glimpses of the Fremen a power of words that caught his entire attention. ‘What a people to win as allies!’ "
5.0,26,text_content,‘And the worms?’ Paul asked. 
5.0,27,text_content,‘What?’ 
5.0,28,text_content,‘I’d like to study more about the sandworms.’

5.0,36,text_content,‘It’s so small.’

5.0,40,text_content,"‘It’s quite old. Let it be our secret, eh? Your parents might think it too valuable for one so young.’ "
5.0,41,text_content,And Yueh thought: ‘His mother would surely wonder at my motives.’ 
5.0,42,text_content,"‘Well …’ Paul closed the book, held it in his hand. ‘If it’s so valuable …’ "

5.0,47,text_content,‘Stop it!’ Yueh barked. 
5.0,48,text_content,"Paul broke off, stared at him. "
5.0,49,text_content,"Yueh closed his eyes, fought to regain composure. ‘What’ ‘perversity caused the book to open at my Wanna’s favorite passage?’ He opened his eyes, saw Paul staring at him. "
5.0,50,text_content,‘Is something wrong?’ Paul asked. 
5.0,51,text_content,up memories that are … painful.’ 
5.0,52,text_content,"‘There are two notches,’ Paul said. "
5.0,53,text_content,"‘Of course,’ Yueh thought. ‘Wanna marked her passage. His fingers are more sensitive than mine and found her mark. It was an accident, no more.’ "
5.0,54,text_content,"‘You may find the book interesting,’ Yueh said. ‘It has much historical truth in it as well as good ethical philosophy.’ "
5.0,55,text_content,he read from it. He had felt something stir his terrible purpose. 
5.0,56,text_content,"‘Your father will be here any minute,’ Yueh said. ‘Put the book away and read it at your leisure.’ "

6.0,5,text_content,"The Duke said: ‘Hard at work, Son?’ "
6.0,6,text_content,"filled with the ache of not showing his fatigue. ‘I must use every opportunity to rest during the crossing to Arrakis,’ he thought. ‘There’ll be no rest on Arrakis.’ "
6.0,7,text_content,"‘Not very hard,’ Paul said. ‘Everything’s so …’ He shrugged. "
6.0,8,text_content,"‘Yes. Well, tomorrow we leave. It’ll be good to get settled in our new home, put all this upset behind.’ "
6.0,9,text_content,"Paul nodded, suddenly overcome by memory of the Reverend Mother’s words: ‘… ‘for the father, nothing.’’ "
6.0,10,text_content,"‘Father,’ Paul said, ‘will Arrakis be as dangerous as everyone says?’ "
6.0,11,text_content,"before it could be vocalized, confronted by the single thought: "
6.0,12,text_content,‘This is my son.’ 
6.0,13,text_content,"‘It’ll be dangerous,’ he admitted. "
6.0,14,text_content,"‘Hawat tells me we have a plan for the Fremen,’ Paul said. And he wondered: ‘Why don’t I tell him what that old woman said? How did she seal my tongue?’ "
6.0,15,text_content,… a subtle gain.’ 
6.0,16,text_content,"‘CHOAM controls the spice,’ Paul said. "
6.0,17,text_content,"‘And Arrakis with its spice is our avenue into CHOAM,’ the Duke said. ‘There’s more to CHOAM than melange.’ "
6.0,18,text_content,‘effort’ it had taken to ask that question.

6.0,20,text_content,‘Does she know about the Fremen?’

6.0,27,text_content,"‘Whoever had stockpiled melange could make a killing,’ Paul said. ‘Others would be out in the cold.’ "
6.0,28,text_content,"The Duke permitted himself a moment of grim satisfaction, looking at his son and thinking how penetrating, how truly ‘educated’ that observation had been. He nodded. ‘The Harkonnens have been stockpiling for more than twenty years.’ "
6.0,29,text_content,‘They mean spice production to fail and you to be blamed.’ 
6.0,30,text_content,A harsh smile twisted the Duke’s mouth. ‘They’d look the other way no matter ‘what was’ done to me.’ 
6.0,31,text_content,‘Even if we were attacked with atomics?’ 
6.0,32,text_content,‘Nothing that flagrant. No ‘open’ defiance of the Convention. But almost anything else short of that … perhaps even dusting and a bit of soil poisoning.’

6.0,35,text_content,‘Who?’

6.0,38,text_content,would the next attack come from?’ 
6.0,39,text_content,‘All the Houses might start stockpiling spice.’ 
6.0,40,text_content,‘Our enemies have a head start – too much of a lead to overcome.’ 
6.0,41,text_content,"‘The Emperor,’ Paul said. ‘That means the Sardaukar.’ "
6.0,42,text_content,"‘Disguised in Harkonnen livery, no doubt,’ the Duke said. ‘But the soldier fanatics nonetheless.’ "
6.0,43,text_content,‘How can Fremen help us against Sardaukar?’ 
6.0,44,text_content,‘Did Hawat talk to you about Salusa Secundus?’ 
6.0,45,text_content,‘The Emperor’s prison planet? No.’

6.0,57,text_content,Paul’s eyes went wide. ‘The Fremen!’ 
6.0,58,text_content,"and wealth to equip them properly. But the Fremen are there … and the spice wealth is there. You see now why we walk into Arrakis, knowing the trap is there.’ "

6.0,60,text_content,policy with planetary populations – spend as little as possible to maintain them.’ 
6.0,61,text_content,The metallic threads in the hawk symbol above his father’s breast glistened as the Duke shifted his position. ‘You see?’ 
6.0,62,text_content,"‘We’re negotiating with the Fremen right now,’ Paul said. "
6.0,63,text_content,"the Fremen will admire him. If we’re lucky, they may judge us by him: Duncan, the moral.’ "
6.0,64,text_content,"‘Duncan, the moral,’ Paul said, ‘and Gurney the valorous.’ "
6.0,65,text_content,"‘You name them well,’ the Duke said. "
6.0,66,text_content,"And Paul thought: ‘Gurney’s one of those the Reverend Mother meant, a supporter of worlds’— ‘‘… the valor of the brave.’’ "
6.0,67,text_content,"‘Gurney tells me you did well in weapons today,’ the Duke said. "
6.0,68,text_content,‘That isn’t what he told me.’ 
6.0,69,text_content,– of the difference between a blade’s edge and its tip.’ 
6.0,70,text_content,"‘Gurney says there’s no artistry in killing with the tip, that it should be done with the edge.’ "
6.0,71,text_content,the rain was drumming. 
6.0,72,text_content,from all accounts – and this thought of skies put him in mind of the space beyond. Are the Guild ships really big?’ he asked. 
6.0,73,text_content,is truly big. Its hold will tuck all our frigates and transports into a little corner – we’ll be just a small part of the ship’s manifest.’ 
6.0,74,text_content,‘And we won’t be able to leave our frigates?’ 
6.0,75,text_content,to fear from them. The Harkonnens know better than to endanger their shipping privileges.’ 
6.0,76,text_content,‘I’m going to watch our screens and try to see a Guildsman.’ 
6.0,77,text_content,"do anything to endanger our shipping privileges, Paul.’ "
6.0,78,text_content,‘Do you think they hide because they’ve mutated and don’t look … ‘human’ anymore?’ 
6.0,79,text_content,‘Who knows?’ The Duke shrugged. ‘It’s a mystery we’re not likely to solve. We’ve more immediate problems – among them: you.’ 
6.0,80,text_content,‘Me?’ 
6.0,81,text_content,"‘Your mother wanted me to be the one to tell you, Son. You see, you may have Mentat capabilities.’ "
6.0,82,text_content,"Paul stared at his father, unable to speak for a moment, then: ‘A Mentat? Me? But I …’ "
6.0,83,text_content,"‘Hawat agrees, Son. It’s true.’ "
6.0,84,text_content,"…’ He broke off, all his past circumstances coming to focus in one flashing computation. ‘I see,’ he said. "
6.0,85,text_content,of it. Only the potential Mentat can tell this for sure about himself.’ 
6.0,86,text_content,of understanding in his mind. 
6.0,87,text_content,"‘You’ll be the Duke someday, Son,’ his father said. A Mentat Duke would be formidable indeed. Can you decide now … or do you need more time?’ "
6.0,88,text_content,There was no hesitation in his answer. ‘I’ll go on with the training.’ 
6.0,89,text_content,"a skull look on the Duke’s narrow features. Paul closed his eyes, feeling the terrible purpose reawaken within him. ‘Perhaps being a Mentat is a terrible purpose,’ he thought. "

7.0,40,text_content,"She held her face immobile, nodded. "
7.0,41,text_content,"‘Hawat already has our own poison snooper over the dining table,’ he said. ‘There’s a portable in your room.’ "

7.0,48,text_content,‘Me?’

7.0,77,text_content,"It was a woman’s voice, thin and stringy. "
7.0,78,text_content,Jessica forced herself not to stare. 
7.0,79,text_content,"The woman gave a stiff-necked nod, said: ‘I am called the Shadout Mapes, Noble Born. What are your orders?’ "
7.0,80,text_content,"‘You may refer to me as “my Lady,”’ Jessica said. ‘I’m not noble born. I’m the bound concubine of the Duke Leto.’ "
7.0,81,text_content,"Again that strange nod, and the woman peered upward at Jessica with a sly questioning. ‘There’s a wife, then?’ "

7.0,84,text_content,And again: ‘Soo-soo Sook!’ 
7.0,85,text_content,‘What ‘is’ that?’ Jessica asked. ‘I heard it several times as we drove through the streets this morning.’ 
7.0,86,text_content,"liters and it’s always kept full.’ She glanced down at her dress ‘Why, you know, my Lady, I don’t even have to wear my stillsuit here!’ She cackled. ‘And me not even dead!’ "
7.0,87,text_content,"in the castle was more imperative. Still, she found the thought unsettling that water was a major mark of wealth here. "
7.0,88,text_content,"‘My husband told me of your title, Shadout,’Jessica said. ‘I recognized the word. It’s a very ancient word.’ "
7.0,89,text_content,"‘You know the ancient tongues then?’ Mapes asked, and she waited with an odd intensity. "
7.0,90,text_content,"‘Tongues are the Bene Gesserit’s first learning,’Jessica said. ‘I know the Bhotani Jib and the Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.’ "
7.0,91,text_content,Mapes nodded. ‘Just as the legend says.’ 
7.0,92,text_content,And Jessica wondered: ‘Why do I play out this sham?’ But the Bene Gesserit ways were devious and compelling. 
7.0,93,text_content,miseces perakri—’ 
7.0,94,text_content,"Mapes took a backward step, appeared poised to flee. "
7.0,95,text_content,in fear and that you have done violence and will yet do more violence. I know many things.’ 
7.0,96,text_content,"In a low voice, Mapes said: ‘I meant no offense, my Lady.’ "
7.0,97,text_content,with a weapon in your bodice.’ 
7.0,98,text_content,"‘My Lady, I …’ "
7.0,99,text_content,"your wildest fears could imagine. There are worse things than dying, you know – even for an entire people.’ "
7.0,100,text_content,‘My Lady!’ Mapes pleaded. She appeared about to fall to her knees. ‘The weapon was sent as a gift to ‘you’ should you prove to be the One.’ 
7.0,101,text_content,Bene Gesserit-trained so terrifying in combat. 
7.0,102,text_content,"‘Now we see which way the decision tips,’ she thought. "
7.0,103,text_content,long. 
7.0,104,text_content,"‘Do you know this, my Lady?’ Mapes asked. "
7.0,105,text_content,and was known only by rumor and wild gossip. 
7.0,106,text_content,"‘It’s a crysknife,’ she said. "
7.0,107,text_content,"‘Say it not lightly,’ Mapes said. ‘Do you know its meaning?’ "
7.0,108,text_content,as the wrong answer.’ Jessica said: ‘It’s a maker—’ 
7.0,109,text_content,shards of reflection shooting around the room. 
7.0,110,text_content,the most casual muscle twitch. 
7.0,111,text_content,The key word was … ‘maker.’ 
7.0,112,text_content,‘Maker? Maker.’ 
7.0,113,text_content,"Mother, would not know the Maker?’ "
7.0,114,text_content,thought about the prophecy – the Shari-a and all the 
7.0,115,text_content,but her purpose accomplished: the protective legends implanted in these people against the day of a Bene Gesserit’s need. 
7.0,116,text_content,"Well, that day had come. "
7.0,117,text_content,"and it begins to disintegrate. It’s yours, a tooth of shaihulud, for as long as you live.’ "
7.0,118,text_content,"Jessica reached out her right hand, risked a gamble: ‘Mapes, you’ve sheathed that blade unblooded.’ "
7.0,119,text_content,my life!’ 
7.0,120,text_content,death-panic come over the woman. 
7.0,121,text_content,"was a thick welling of blood that stopped almost immediately. ‘Ultrafast coagulation,’ Jessica thought. ‘A moisture-conserving mutation?’ "
7.0,122,text_content,"She sheathed the blade, said: ‘Button your dress, Mapes.’ "
7.0,123,text_content,"Mapes obeyed, trembling. The eyes without whites stared at Jessica, ‘You are ours,’ she muttered. ‘You are the One.’ "
7.0,124,text_content,"‘Who sees that knife must be cleansed or slain!’ she snarled. ‘You ‘know’ that, my Lady!’ "
7.0,125,text_content,"‘I know it now,’ Jessica thought. "
7.0,126,text_content,The cargo handlers left without intruding on the Great Hall. 
7.0,127,text_content,She glanced at the stacked boxes and piled goods around them. ‘And there’s work aplenty to while the time for us here.’ 
7.0,128,text_content,Jessica hesitated. ‘‘The thing must take its course.’’ That was a specific catchphrase from the Missionaria Protectiva’s stock of incantations – ‘The coming of the Reverend Mother to free you.’ 
7.0,129,text_content,"‘But I’m not a Reverend Mother,’ Jessica thought. And then: ‘Great Mother! They planted’ that ‘one here! This must be a hideous place!’ "
7.0,130,text_content,"In matter-of-fact tones, Mapes said: ‘What’ll you be wanting me to do first, my Lady?’ "
7.0,131,text_content,one side of the dining hall. The bull’s head must go on the wall opposite the painting.’

7.0,133,text_content,‘No.’ 
7.0,134,text_content,‘But there’s dirt caked on its horns.’ 
7.0,135,text_content,hours after this beast killed the Old Duke.’ 
7.0,136,text_content,"Mapes stood up. ‘Ah, now!’ she said. "
7.0,137,text_content,"‘It’s just blood,’Jessica said. ‘Old blood at that. Get some help hanging these now. The beastly things are heavy.’ "
7.0,138,text_content,‘Did you think the blood bothered me?’ Mapes asked. ‘I’m of the desert and I’ve seen blood aplenty.’ 
7.0,139,text_content,"‘I … see that you have,’Jessica said. "
7.0,140,text_content,"‘And some of it my own,’ Mapes said. ‘More’n you drew with your puny scratch.’ "
7.0,141,text_content,‘You’d rather I’d cut deeper?’ 
7.0,142,text_content,"‘Ah, no! The body’s water is scant enough ’thout gushing a wasteful lot of it into the air. You did the thing right.’ "
7.0,143,text_content,a sense of oppression at the importance of water on Arrakis. 
7.0,144,text_content,"‘On which side of the dining hall shall I hang which one of these pretties, my Lady?’ Mapes asked. "
7.0,145,text_content,"‘Ever the practical one, this Mapes,’ Jessica thought. She said: ‘Use your own judgment, Mapes. It makes no real difference.’ "
7.0,146,text_content,"‘As you say, my Lady.’ Mapes stooped, began clearing wrappings and twine from the head. ‘Killed an old duke, did you?’ she crooned. "
7.0,147,text_content,‘Shall I summon a handler to help you?’Jessica asked. 
7.0,148,text_content,"‘I’ll manage, my Lady.’ "
7.0,149,text_content,"‘Yes, she’ll manage,’ Jessica thought. ‘There’s that about this Fremen creature: the drive to manage.’ "

7.0,152,text_content,"‘As you will, my Lady,’ Mapes said. "

8.0,3,text_content,his attention fixed upon the outside world. 
8.0,4,text_content,Jessica took another silent step into the room. 
8.0,5,text_content,seemed alive – turning slightly to follow some movement outside. 
8.0,6,text_content,bedroom for which Paul had expressed a liking. 
8.0,7,text_content,"‘Good afternoon, Dr Yueh,’ she said. ‘Where’s Paul?’ "
8.0,8,text_content,I sent him into the next room to rest.’ 
8.0,9,text_content,… I … did not mean to be familiar.’ 
8.0,10,text_content,"She smiled, held out her right hand. For a moment, she was afraid he might kneel. ‘Wellington, please.’ "
8.0,11,text_content,‘To use your name like that … I …’ 
8.0,12,text_content,"‘We’ve known each other six years,’ she said. ‘It’s long past time formalities should’ve been dropped between us – in private.’ "
8.0,13,text_content,reasons when she believes she already knows the answer.’ 
8.0,14,text_content,Jessica.’ 
8.0,15,text_content,‘Sorry for me? Whatever for?’ 
8.0,16,text_content,"Yueh shrugged. Long ago, he had realized Jessica was not gifted with the full Truthsay as his Wanna had been. Still, he always used the truth with Jessica whenever possible. It was safest. "
8.0,17,text_content,Those townswomen we passed on the way here wailing beneath their veils. The way they looked at us.’ 
8.0,18,text_content,the Harkonnens.’ She looked past him out the windows. ‘What were you staring at out there?’ 
8.0,19,text_content,He turned back to the window. ‘The people.’ 
8.0,20,text_content,"– and went on to study the passing throng, wondering why Yueh found them so absorbing. "
8.0,21,text_content,hate … even a sense of hope. Each person raked those trees with a fixity of expression. 
8.0,22,text_content,‘Do you know what they’re thinking?’ Yueh asked. 
8.0,23,text_content,‘You profess to read minds?’ she asked. 
8.0,24,text_content,"‘Those minds,’ he said. ‘They look at those trees and they think: “There are one hundred of us.” That’s what they think.’ "
8.0,25,text_content,She turned a puzzled frown on him. ‘Why?’ 
8.0,26,text_content,"then, equals five men. There are twenty palms out there – one hundred men.’ "
8.0,27,text_content,‘But some of those people look at the trees hopefully.’ 
8.0,28,text_content,"‘They but hope some dates will fall, except it’s the wrong season.’ "
8.0,29,text_content,"‘We look at this place with too critical an eye,’ she said. ‘There’s hope as well as danger here. The spice ‘could’ make us rich. With a fat treasury, we can make this world into whatever we wish.’ "
8.0,30,text_content,"And she laughed silently at herself: ‘Who am I trying to convince?’ The laugh broke through her restraints, emerging brittle, without humor. ‘But you can’t buy security,’ she said. "
8.0,31,text_content,The ways of the Harkonnen cruelty were devious. Wanna might not be dead. He had to be certain. 
8.0,32,text_content,"‘Do not worry for us, Wellington,’ Jessica said. ‘The problem’s ours, not yours.’ "
8.0,33,text_content,him then where he is weakest – in his gloating moment!’ 
8.0,34,text_content,He sighed. 
8.0,35,text_content,‘Would it disturb Paul if I looked in on him?’ she asked. 
8.0,36,text_content,‘Not at all. I gave him a sedative.’ 
8.0,37,text_content,‘He’s taking the change well?’ she asked. 
8.0,38,text_content,"to the door, opened it. ‘He’s in here.’ "
8.0,39,text_content,"Jessica followed, peered into a shadowy room. "
8.0,40,text_content,the bed wove a loom of shadows across face and blanket. 
8.0,41,text_content,that outline like maturity emerging from childhood. 
8.0,42,text_content,"by Yuen’s presence. She stepped back, closed the door softly. "
8.0,43,text_content,"to serve a different purpose? What could it have been? She loved me, certainly.’ "
8.0,44,text_content,his mind could grasp. 
8.0,45,text_content,"Jessica stopped beside him, said: ‘What delicious abandon in the sleep of a child.’ "
8.0,46,text_content,He spoke mechanically: ‘If only adults could relax like that.’ 
8.0,47,text_content,‘Yes.’ 
8.0,48,text_content,‘Where do we lose it?’ he murmured. 
8.0,49,text_content,thinking of the differences in his life now – so very different from the life they once had planned for him. 
8.0,50,text_content,"‘We do, indeed, lose something,’ she said. "
8.0,51,text_content,like the crysknife concealed in her bodice. 
8.0,52,text_content,"‘The sky’s so dark,’ she said. "
8.0,53,text_content,"‘That’s partly the lack of moisture,’ he said. "
8.0,54,text_content,"‘Water!’ she snapped. ‘Everywhere you turn here, you’re involved with the lack of water!’ "
8.0,55,text_content,"‘It’s the precious mystery of Arrakis,’ he said. "
8.0,56,text_content,you read about those?’ 
8.0,57,text_content,"‘First a trickle, then nothing,’ he said. "
8.0,58,text_content,produces the same result: a trickle that stops. Has no one ever been curious about this?’ 
8.0,59,text_content,"‘It is curious,’ he said. ‘You suspect some living agency? Wouldn’t that have shown in core samples?’ "
8.0,60,text_content,is stopped. Something plugs it. That’s my suspicion.’ 
8.0,61,text_content,was reason to suppress this.’ 
8.0,62,text_content,"the major source of water here, caught in windtraps and precipitators. Where does that come from?’ "
8.0,63,text_content,‘The polar caps?’ 
8.0,64,text_content,and not all of those things are directly involved with the spice.’ 
8.0,65,text_content,looking at him. ‘Is something wrong?’ 
8.0,66,text_content,"I didn’t know you had personal reasons to hate them, Wellington.’ "
8.0,67,text_content,as I can.’ 
8.0,68,text_content,"Then: ‘They …’ The words would not come out. He felt panic, closed his eyes tightly, experiencing the agony in his chest and little else until a hand touched his arm gently. "
8.0,69,text_content,another poor victim bound to the Atreides by a cherem of hate.’ 
8.0,70,text_content,"That, at least, was truth. "
8.0,71,text_content,much lines of sorrow as of age. A deep affection for him came over her. 
8.0,72,text_content,"‘Wellington, I’m sorry we brought you into this dangerous place,’ she said. "
8.0,73,text_content,"‘I came willingly,’ he said. And that, too, was true. "
8.0,74,text_content,‘But this whole planet’s a Harkonnen trap. You must know that.’ 
8.0,75,text_content,"‘It will take more than a trap to catch the Duke Leto,’ he said. And that, too, was true. "
8.0,76,text_content,"‘Perhaps I should be more confident of him,’ she said. ‘He is a brilliant tactician.’ "
8.0,77,text_content,"‘We’ve been uprooted,’ he said. ‘That’s why we’re uneasy.’ "
8.0,78,text_content,"‘And how easy it is to kill the uprooted plant,’ she said. ‘Especially when you put it down in hostile soil.’ "
8.0,79,text_content,‘Are we certain the soil’s hostile?’ 
8.0,80,text_content,only when the people learned we were installing new windtraps and condensers to take care of the load.’ 
8.0,81,text_content,hostility toward him.’ 
8.0,82,text_content,"‘And guards,’ she said. ‘Guards everywhere. And shields. You see the blurring of them everywhere you look. We did not live this way on Caladan.’ "
8.0,83,text_content,"‘Give this planet a chance,’ he said. "
8.0,84,text_content,"‘Where Thufir Hawat goes, death and deceit follow.’ "
8.0,85,text_content,‘You malign him.’ 
8.0,86,text_content,‘Malign? I praise him. Death and deceit are our only hopes now. I just do not fool myself about Thufir’s methods.’ 
8.0,87,text_content,"‘You should … keep busy,’ he said. ‘Give yourself no time for such morbid—’ "
8.0,88,text_content,Gesserit business training figured in his choice of me.’ 
8.0,89,text_content,"‘What do you mean?’ He found himself caught by the cynical tone, the bitterness that he had never seen her expose. "
8.0,90,text_content,"‘Don’t you think, Wellington,’ she asked, ‘that a secretary bound to one by love is so much safer?’ "
8.0,91,text_content,"‘That is not a worthy thought, Jessica.’ "
8.0,92,text_content,as he followed her with his eyes. 
8.0,93,text_content,She sighed. You’re right. It’s not worthy.’ 
8.0,94,text_content,"Again, she hugged herself, pressing the sheathed crysknife against her flesh and thinking of the unfinished business it represented. "
8.0,95,text_content,"of the CHOAM pocketbook. But the poison in him, deep in his mind, is the knowledge that an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice after the Battle of Corrín.’ "
8.0,96,text_content,"the one source in the universe of melange, the prolonger of life, the giver of health. "
8.0,97,text_content,‘What are you thinking?’ she asked. 
8.0,98,text_content,is wealth to buy many things.’ 
8.0,99,text_content,"‘Does greed touch even you, Wellington?’ "
8.0,100,text_content,‘Not greed.’ 
8.0,101,text_content,‘What then?’ 
8.0,102,text_content,He shrugged. ‘Futility.’ He glanced at her. ‘Can you remember your first taste of spice?’ 
8.0,103,text_content,‘It tasted like cinnamon.’ 
8.0,104,text_content,"– slightly euphoric. And, like life, never to be truly synthesized.’ "
8.0,105,text_content,"‘I think it would’ve been wiser for us to go renegade, to take ourselves beyond the Imperial reach,’ she said. "
8.0,106,text_content,"He saw that she hadn’t been listening to him, focused on her words, wondering: ‘Yes – why didn’t she make him do this? She could make him do virtually anything.’ "
8.0,107,text_content,question?’ 
8.0,108,text_content,She pressed against the window ledge in an unexplainable pang of disquiet. ‘Of course not. You’re … my friend.’ 
8.0,109,text_content,Why haven’t you made the Duke marry you?’ 
8.0,110,text_content,"She whirled, head up, glaring. ‘Made him marry me? But—’ "
8.0,111,text_content,"‘I should not have asked,’ he said. "
8.0,112,text_content,"humanity. It degrades everything it touches. If I made him do … this, then it would not be his doing.’ "
8.0,113,text_content,"He had never been closer to speaking out, confessing his secret role. "
8.0,114,text_content,man had died when my Duke was born!’ 
8.0,115,text_content,"In the silence that came between them, a breeze from a ventilator could be heard fingering the blinds. "
8.0,116,text_content,before I assign quarters.’ 
8.0,117,text_content,He nodded. ‘Of course.’ And he thought: ‘If only there were some way not to do this thing that I must do.’ 
8.0,118,text_content,"Jessica dropped her arms, crossed to the hall door and stood there a moment, hesitating, then let herself out. ‘All the time we talked he was hiding something, holding something back,’ she thought. ‘To save my feelings, no doubt. He’s a good man.’ Again, she hesitated, almost turned back to confront Yueh and drag the hidden thing from him. ‘But that would only shame him, frighten him to learn he’s so easily read. I should place more trust in my friends.’ "
9.0,1,opening_text,"they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult, Muad’Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson. "

9.0,11,text_content,"Names and pictures, names and pictures from man’s terranic past – and many to be found now nowhere else in the universe except here on Arrakis. "
9.0,12,text_content,So many new things to learn about – the spice. 
9.0,13,text_content,And the sandworms. 
9.0,14,text_content,something to read and remain in the other room. 
9.0,15,text_content,Now was the moment to go exploring. 
9.0,16,text_content,his life. 
9.0,17,text_content,organ. 
9.0,18,text_content,"The seeker lifted, swung sideways across the room and back. "
9.0,19,text_content,shields and their wits. 
9.0,20,text_content,"Now, Paul held himself in near catatonic immobility, knowing he had only his wits to meet this threat. "
9.0,21,text_content,quartering the room. 
9.0,22,text_content,"‘I must try to grab it,’ he thought. ‘The suspensor field will make it slippery on the bottom. I must grip tightly.’ "
9.0,23,text_content,"The thing dropped a half meter, quartered to the left, circled back around the bed. A faint humming could be heard from it. "
9.0,24,text_content,"‘Who is operating that thing?’ Paul wondered. ‘It has to be someone near. I could shout for Yueh, but it would take him the instant the door opened.’ "
9.0,25,text_content,The hall door behind Paul creaked. A rap sounded there. The door opened. 
9.0,26,text_content,The hunter-seeker arrowed past his head toward the motion. 
9.0,27,text_content,crunch of it as the nose eye smashed and the seeker went dead in his hand. 
9.0,28,text_content,"Still, he held it – to be certain. "
9.0,29,text_content,"Paul’s eyes came up, met the open stare of total blue from the Shadout Mapes. "
9.0,30,text_content,"‘Your father has sent for you,’ she said. ‘There are men in the hall to escort you.’ "
9.0,31,text_content,at the thing clutched in his hand. 
9.0,32,text_content,"‘I’ve heard of suchlike,’ she said. ‘It would’ve killed me, not so?’ "
9.0,33,text_content,He had to swallow before he could speak. ‘I … was its target.’ 
9.0,34,text_content,‘But it was coming for me.’ 
9.0,35,text_content,‘Because you were moving.’ And he wondered: ‘Who is this creature?’ 
9.0,36,text_content,"‘Then you saved my life,’ she said. "
9.0,37,text_content,‘I saved both our lives.’ 
9.0,38,text_content,"‘Seems like you could’ve let it have me and made your own escape,’ she said. "
9.0,39,text_content,‘Who are you?’ he asked. 
9.0,40,text_content,"‘The Shadout Mapes, housekeeper.’ "
9.0,41,text_content,‘How did you know where to find me?’ 
9.0,42,text_content,men are still waiting.’ 
9.0,43,text_content,"‘Those will be Hawat’s men,’ he thought. ‘We must find the operator of this thing.’ "
9.0,44,text_content,to be a stranger among us.’ 
9.0,45,text_content,And he wondered: ‘Could it be this creature?’ But he knew it wasn’t. The seeker had been under control when she entered. 
9.0,46,text_content,flesh-cutter.’ 
9.0,47,text_content,"Paul absorbed this in silence: ‘a traitor.’ Before he could speak, the odd woman whirled away and ran back toward the entry. "
9.0,48,text_content,and now she was going to do his ‘bidding.’ The house would be swarming with Hawat’s men in a minute.

10.0,15,text_content,"‘Hawat certified this place,’ Jessica thought. ‘There can’t be anything too terrible in here.’ "
10.0,16,text_content,She pushed the door. It swung inward onto a small room with another oval door opposite. The other door had a wheel handle.

10.0,18,text_content,She stepped over the lip into the little room. 
10.0,19,text_content,‘Why an airlock in a house?’ she asked herself. And she thought suddenly of exotic creatures sealed off in special climates. 
10.0,20,text_content,‘Special climate!’

10.0,29,text_content,‘Even roses!’

11.0,8,text_content,‘Something in the position of the pad?’ she wondered. 
11.0,9,text_content,scanned them in a single passage:

11.0,11,text_content,"glanced at the fountain, thrust his hand and the thing it clutched under the falling water. "
11.0,12,text_content,"‘Paul!’ She grabbed his shoulder, staring at the hand. ‘What is that?’ "
11.0,13,text_content,I want to be sure. Water should short it out.’ 
11.0,14,text_content,‘Immerse it!’ she commanded. 
11.0,15,text_content,He obeyed. 
11.0,16,text_content,"Presently, she said: ‘Withdraw your hand. Leave the thing in the water.’ "
11.0,17,text_content,prodded the deadly sliver. 
11.0,18,text_content,It was dead. 
11.0,19,text_content,"She dropped the stem into the water, looked at Paul. His eyes studied the room with a searching intensity that she recognized – the B.G. Way. "
11.0,20,text_content,"‘This place could conceal anything,’ he said. "
11.0,21,text_content,"‘I’ve reason to believe it’s safe,’ she said. "

11.0,24,text_content,"But she thought of the message of the leaf: ‘… ‘defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant.’ Not Hawat, surely. Oh, surely not Hawat.’ "
11.0,25,text_content,"‘Hawat’s men are searching the house right now,’ he said. ‘That seeker almost got the old woman who came to wake me.’ "
11.0,26,text_content,"‘The Shadout Mapes,’ Jessica said, remembering the encounter at the stairs. ‘A summons from your father to—’ "
11.0,27,text_content,"‘That can wait,’ Paul said. ‘Why do you think this room’s safe?’ "
11.0,28,text_content,"She pointed to the note, explained about it. "
11.0,29,text_content,He relaxed slightly. 
11.0,30,text_content,"But Jessica remained inwardly tense, thinking: ‘A hunter-seeker! Merciful Mother!’ It took all her training to prevent a fit of hysterical trembling. "
11.0,31,text_content,"Paul spoke matter-of-factly: ‘It’s the Harkonnens, of course. We shall have to destroy them.’ "
11.0,32,text_content,A rapping sounded at the airlock door – the code knock of one of Hawat’s corps. 
11.0,33,text_content,"‘Come in,’ Paul called. "
11.0,34,text_content,a man in it. He had a seeker console.’ 
11.0,35,text_content,"‘I’ll want to take part in the interrogation,’ Jessica said. "
11.0,36,text_content,"‘Sorry, my Lady. We messed him up catching him. He died.’ "
11.0,37,text_content,‘Nothing to identify him?’ she asked. 
11.0,38,text_content,"‘We’ve found nothing yet, my Lady.’ "
11.0,39,text_content,‘Was he an Arrakeen native?’ Paul asked. 
11.0,40,text_content,Jessica nodded at the astuteness of the question.

11.0,42,text_content,"‘No one questions your thoroughness,’ Jessica said. "
11.0,43,text_content,"‘I question it, my Lady. We should’ve used sonic probes down there.’ "
11.0,44,text_content,"‘I presume that’s what you’re doing now,’ Paul said. "

11.0,46,text_content,‘Send word to my father that we’ll be delayed.’ 
11.0,47,text_content,in a safe place.’ Again his eyes swept the room. ‘What of this place?’ 
11.0,48,text_content,"‘I’ve reason to believe it safe,’ she said. ‘Both Hawat and I have inspected it.’ "

11.0,51,text_content,"‘This wing was the only place I hadn’t examined,’ she said. ‘I put it off to last because …’ "
11.0,52,text_content,"‘Because Hawat gave it his personal attention,’ he said. "
11.0,53,text_content,"She darted a quick look at his face, questioning. "
11.0,54,text_content,‘Do you distrust Hawat?’ she asked. 
11.0,55,text_content,"‘No, but he’s getting old … he’s overworked. We could take some of the load from him.’ "
11.0,56,text_content,hears about this. He’ll be shamed that…’ 
11.0,57,text_content,"‘We must take our own measures,’ he said. "
11.0,58,text_content,… many times over.’ 
11.0,59,text_content,Paul said: ‘When my father is bothered by something you’ve done he says ‘“Bene Gesserit!”’ like a swear word.’ 
11.0,60,text_content,‘And what is it about me that bothers your father?’ 
11.0,61,text_content,‘When you argue with him.’ 
11.0,62,text_content,"‘You are not your father, Paul.’ "
11.0,63,text_content,"And Paul thought: ‘It’ll worry her, but I must tell her what that Mapes woman said about a traitor among us.’ "
11.0,64,text_content,"‘What’re you holding back?’Jessica asked. ‘This isn’t like you, Paul’ "
11.0,65,text_content,"He shrugged, recounted the exchange with Mapes. "
11.0,66,text_content,"And Jessica thought of the message of the leaf. She came to a sudden decision, showed Paul the leaf, told him its message. "
11.0,67,text_content,"‘My father must learn of this at once,’ he said. ‘I’ll radiograph it in code and get it off.’ "
11.0,68,text_content,"‘No,’ she said. ‘You will wait until you can see him alone. As few as possible must learn about it.’ "
11.0,69,text_content,‘Do you mean we should trust no one?’ 
11.0,70,text_content,"believe it’s true, but it may be that the only purpose was to get this message to us.’ "
11.0,71,text_content,"Paul’s face remained sturdily somber. ‘To sow distrust and suspicion in our ranks, to weaken us that way,’ he said. "
11.0,72,text_content,"‘You must tell your father privately and caution him about this aspect of it,’ she said. "
11.0,73,text_content,‘I understand.’ 
11.0,74,text_content,ball low above the cliffs. 
11.0,75,text_content,"Paul turned with her, said: ‘I don’t think it’s Hawat, either. Is it possible it’s Yueh?’ "

11.0,80,text_content,Paul stirred beside her in the dusky room. 
11.0,81,text_content,"But Jessica concentrated on that single bright star, realizing that it was ‘too’ low, that it must come from the Shield Wall cliffs. "
11.0,82,text_content,‘Someone signaling!’ 
11.0,83,text_content,"She tried to read the message, but it was in no code she had ever learned. "
11.0,84,text_content,"off to their left grew brighter, began to wink back at the cliff – very fast: blinksquirt, glimmer, blink! "
11.0,85,text_content,And it was gone. 
11.0,86,text_content,The false star in the cliff winked out immediately. 
11.0,87,text_content,Signals … and they filled her with premonition. 
11.0,88,text_content,‘Why were lights used to signal across the basin?’ she asked herself. ‘Why couldn’t they use the communications network?’

12.0,37,text_content,"‘Yours to command, my Lord.’ "
12.0,38,text_content,"They moved into an alcove beside a coin-slot water machine while the men stirred restlessly in the big room. Halleck dropped his bag into a corner, kept his grip on the baliset. "
12.0,39,text_content,‘How many men can you let Hawat have?’ the Duke asked.

12.0,42,text_content,"‘I can let him have three hundred of my best,’ Halleck said. ‘Where shall I send them?’ "

12.0,60,text_content,"Halleck stopped in the act of turning away, caught Leto’s eye. ‘Are you anticipating ‘that’ kind of trouble, Sire? I thought there was a Judge of the Change here.’ "
12.0,61,text_content,"‘Both open battle and secret,’ the Duke said. ‘There’ll be blood aplenty spilled here before we’re through.’ "
12.0,62,text_content,"‘“And the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land,”’ Halleck quoted. "

13.0,6,text_content,"The Duke stopped across from Paul, pounded the table: ‘Hawat told me that house was secure!’ "
13.0,7,text_content,Hawat.’ 
13.0,8,text_content,‘Are you defending him?’ the Duke demanded. 
13.0,9,text_content,‘Yes.’ 
13.0,10,text_content,‘He’s getting old. That’s it. He should be—’ 
13.0,11,text_content,"‘He’s wise with much experience,’ Paul said. ‘How many of Hawat’s mistakes can you recall?’ "
13.0,12,text_content,"‘I should be the one defending him,’ the Duke said. ‘Not you. "

13.0,15,text_content,"the white wall behind his father, then down to the shiny surface of the table, seeing his own hands clenched into fists there. "
13.0,16,text_content,"The door opposite the Duke banged open. Thufir Hawat strode through it looking older and more leathery than ever. He paced down the length of the table, stopped at attention facing Leto. "
13.0,17,text_content,I tender my resig—’ 
13.0,18,text_content,"He tapped the back of the empty chair. ‘Sit down, I say!’ "
13.0,19,text_content,Hawat sank into the chair. ‘But—’ 
13.0,20,text_content,"‘I’ll hear no more of it,’ the Duke said. ‘The incident is past. We have more pressing business. Where are the others?’ "
13.0,21,text_content,‘I asked them to wait outside while I—’ 
13.0,22,text_content,‘Call them in.’ 
13.0,23,text_content,"Hawat looked into Leto’s eyes. ‘Sire, I—’ "
13.0,24,text_content,"‘I know who my true friends are, Thufir,’ the Duke said. ‘Call in the men.’ "
13.0,25,text_content,"Hawat swallowed. ‘At once, my Lord.’ He swiveled in the chair, called to the open door: ‘Gurney, bring them in.’ "
13.0,26,text_content,stimulant wafted down the table. 
13.0,27,text_content,"‘There’s coffee for those who want it,’ the Duke said. "
13.0,28,text_content,"He looked over his men, thinking: ‘They’re a good crew. A man could do far worse for this kind of war.’ He waited while coffee was brought in from the adjoining room and served, noting the tiredness in some of the faces. "
13.0,29,text_content,"Presently, he put on his mask of quiet efficiency, stood up and commanded their attention with a knuckle rap against the table. "
13.0,30,text_content,obey a simple order of the Imperium without the old ways cropping up.’ 
13.0,31,text_content,the correct tone to lift the mood here. Even the hint of fatigue in his voice was right. 
13.0,32,text_content,"‘I think first we’d better learn if Thufir has anything to add to his report on the Fremen,’ the Duke said. ‘Thufir?’ "
13.0,33,text_content,"the Lady Jessica, spice liquor, candy, medicinals. My men are processing the lot right now. There appears to be no trickery.’ "
13.0,34,text_content,"‘You like these people, Thufir?’ asked a man down the table. "
13.0,35,text_content,Hawat turned to face his questioner. ‘Duncan Idaho says they’re to be admired.’ 
13.0,36,text_content,"Paul glanced at his father, back to Hawat, ventured a question: ‘Have you any new information on how many Fremen there are?’ "
13.0,37,text_content,are a great many such sietch communities. All seem to give their allegiance to someone called Liet.’ 
13.0,38,text_content,"‘That’s something new,’ Leto said. "
13.0,39,text_content,"‘It could be an error on my part, Sire. There are things to suggest this Liet may be a local deity.’ "
13.0,40,text_content,"Another man down the table cleared his throat, asked: ‘Is it certain they deal with the smugglers?’ "
13.0,41,text_content,they faced an eighteen-day journey.’ 
13.0,42,text_content,to have them completely outside our observation – that’s not good.’ 
13.0,43,text_content,"‘You have a plan, Sire?’ Hawat asked. "
13.0,44,text_content,men heretofore required in their operations have been costing them four times that amount.’

13.0,47,text_content,of this.’ 
13.0,48,text_content,"The Duke turned to Hawat. ‘Thufir, did you get those account books you said you could buy?’ "
13.0,49,text_content,"‘Yes, my Lord. They’re being examined in detail even now. I’ve skimmed them, though, and can give a first approximation.’ "
13.0,50,text_content,"‘Give it, then.’ "
13.0,51,text_content,‘The Harkonnens took ten billion Solaris out of here every three hundred and thirty Standard days.’ 
13.0,52,text_content,wide-eyed looks. 
13.0,53,text_content,Halleck murmured: ‘“For they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of the treasure hid in the sand.”’ 
13.0,54,text_content,away from all this merely because the Emperor ordered it?’ 
13.0,55,text_content,"There was a general shaking of heads, murmurous agreement. "
13.0,56,text_content,"How many sand-crawlers, harvesters, spice factories, and supporting equipment have they left us?’ "
13.0,57,text_content,a fourth of it’s still working six months from now.’ 
13.0,58,text_content,"‘Pretty much as we expected,’ Leto said. ‘What’s the firm estimate on basic equipment?’ "

13.0,60,text_content,satellite?’ 
13.0,61,text_content,"The Duke looked at Hawat. ‘Nothing new there, eh, Thufir?’ "
13.0,62,text_content,Our task is to find out why before we approach him again.’

13.0,65,text_content,"The man stared at the Duke, then: ‘No, Sire. You couldn’t turn down the richest planetary source of income in our universe … and I could do nought but follow you. Forgive the outburst, but …’ He shrugged. ‘…we must all feel bitter at times.’ "

13.0,70,text_content,along the table stood up to get a better look at it. 
13.0,71,text_content,"Paul leaned forward, staring at the machine. "

13.0,74,text_content,"job, a threat hanging over their workers’ heads. Be good or you’ll be assigned to Old Maria.’ "
13.0,75,text_content,Chuckles sounded around the table. 
13.0,76,text_content,"pointed to the image on the table, said: ‘Thufir, are there sandworms big enough to swallow that whole?’ "
13.0,77,text_content,"Quick silence settled on the table. The Duke cursed under his breath, then thought: ‘No – they have to face the realities here.’ "
13.0,78,text_content,Wall where most of the spicing’s done there are plenty of worms that could cripple this factory and devour it at their leisure.’ 
13.0,79,text_content,‘Why don’t we shield them?’ Paul asked. 
13.0,80,text_content,doubt it. Idaho saw no evidence of shield equipment at the sietch.’ 
13.0,81,text_content,‘None at all?’ Paul asked. 
13.0,82,text_content,part of the sietch. He saw no shields or any indication of their use.’ 
13.0,83,text_content,"‘It’s a puzzle,’ the Duke said. "
13.0,84,text_content,their accounts show a heavy expenditure for shield replacements and parts.’ 
13.0,85,text_content,‘Could the Fremen have a way of nullifying shields?’ Paul asked. 
13.0,86,text_content,"to do the trick, but no one’s ever been able to put it to the test.’ "
13.0,87,text_content,such a device if it were available. And they’d have had no inhibitions against marketing it off planet.’ 
13.0,88,text_content,of this problem.’ 
13.0,89,text_content,amused by them.’ 
13.0,90,text_content,"The Duke frowned, then: ‘The subject under discussion is spicing equipment.’ "
13.0,91,text_content,Hawat gestured to his aide at the projector. 
13.0,92,text_content,is a process of getting in and getting out with as much as possible.’ 
13.0,93,text_content,"‘Admirably suited to Harkonnen morality,’ the Duke said. "
13.0,94,text_content,Laughter was abrupt and too loud. 
13.0,95,text_content,An ornithopter replaced the carryall in the projection focus.

13.0,98,text_content,then should be able to boost it up to twelve or fifteen per cent where it belongs.’ He opened his eyes. ‘Unless my Lord wishes to adopt Harkonnen methods.’ 
13.0,99,text_content,happy – especially the Fremen.’ 
13.0,100,text_content,"‘Most especially the Fremen,’ Hawat agreed. "
13.0,101,text_content,new lot would have its quota of provocateurs.’ 
13.0,102,text_content,should be down a third from the Harkonnen average.’ 
13.0,103,text_content,of Fremen troops before the first CHOAM audit.’ 
13.0,104,text_content,"‘That’s not much time, Sire,’ Hawat said. "
13.0,105,text_content,"How many do you think they’ll ship in, Thufir?’ "
13.0,106,text_content,"‘Four or five battalions all told, Sire. No more, Guild troop-transport costs being what they are.’ "
13.0,107,text_content,of the Landsraad Council and matters will be much different – profits or no profits.’ 
13.0,108,text_content,"‘We’ll do our best, Sire.’ "
13.0,109,text_content,of shoulders and the thin set of the lips with the cranberry-colored stain of sapho juice. 
13.0,110,text_content,"‘So much depends on one aged man,’ Paul thought. "
13.0,111,text_content,of the Harkonnen machine here?’ 
13.0,112,text_content,a hundred people in all.’ 
13.0,113,text_content,"‘These Harkonnen creatures you eliminated,’ the Duke said, ‘were they propertied?’ "
13.0,114,text_content,"‘Most were well situated, my Lord – in the entrepreneur class.’ "
13.0,115,text_content,"everything, turn out their families, strip them. And make sure the Crown gets its ten per cent. It must be entirely legal.’ "
13.0,116,text_content,me I didn’t think of it first.’ 
13.0,117,text_content,"Halleck frowned across the table, surprised a deep scowl on Paul’s face. The others were smiling and nodding. "
13.0,118,text_content,"‘It’s wrong,’ Paul thought. ‘This’ll only make the others fight all the harder. They’ve nothing to gain by surrendering.’ "
13.0,119,text_content,as it gave them victory. 
13.0,120,text_content,"‘“I have been a stranger in a strange land,”’ Halleck quoted. "
13.0,121,text_content,"Paul stared at him, recognizing the quotation from the O.C. Bible, wondering: ‘Does Gurney, too, wish an end to devious plots?’ "
13.0,122,text_content,to stay with us?’ 
13.0,123,text_content,"‘Two hundred eighty-six in all, Sire. I think we should take them and consider ourselves lucky. They’re all in useful categories.’ "
13.0,124,text_content,"‘No more?’ The Duke pursed his lips, then: ‘Well, pass the word along to—’ "
13.0,125,text_content,"A disturbance at the door interrupted him. Duncan Idaho came through the guard there, hurried down the length of the table and bent over the Duke’s ear. "
13.0,126,text_content,"Leto waved him back, said: ‘Speak out, Duncan. You can see this is strategy staff’ "
13.0,127,text_content,the mask of serenity over excitement. 
13.0,128,text_content,"‘A knife, m’Lord, a knife the like of which you’ve never seen.’ "
13.0,129,text_content,‘Crysknife?’ someone asked. 
13.0,130,text_content,a sheath with a black-ridged handle protruding from it. 
13.0,131,text_content,‘Keep that blade in its sheath!’ 
13.0,132,text_content,"The voice came from the open door at the end of the room, a vibrant and penetrating voice that brought them all up, staring. "
13.0,133,text_content,man except for a gap in the hood and black veil that exposed eyes of total blue – no white in them at all. 
13.0,134,text_content,"‘Let him enter,’ Idaho whispered. "
13.0,135,text_content,"‘Pass that man,’ the Duke said. "
13.0,136,text_content,"The guards hesitated, then lowered their swords. "
13.0,137,text_content,"The man swept into the room, stood across from the Duke. "
13.0,138,text_content,"‘This is Stilgar, chief of the sietch I visited, leader of those who warned us of the false band,’ Idaho said. "
13.0,139,text_content,"‘Welcome, sir,’ Leto said. ‘And why shouldn’t we unsheath this blade?’ "
13.0,140,text_content,defile an honorable weapon?’ 
13.0,141,text_content,"‘I am the Duke Leto,’ the Duke said. ‘Would you permit me to see this blade?’ "
13.0,142,text_content,"raised a thin, darkly veined hand. ‘I remind you this is the blade of one who befriended you.’ "
13.0,143,text_content,"In the waiting silence, Paul studied the man, sensing the aura of power that radiated from him. He was a leader – a ‘Fremen’ leader. "
13.0,144,text_content,A man near the center of the table across from Paul muttered: ‘Who’s he to tell us what rights we have on Arrakis?’ 
13.0,145,text_content,‘They are ours. They may never leave Arrakis without our consent.’ 
13.0,146,text_content,whether—’ 
13.0,147,text_content,"dignity. I am indeed indebted to you. And I ‘always’ pay my debts. If it is your custom that this knife remain sheathed here, then it is so ordered – by ‘me.’ And if there is any other way we may honor the man who died in our service, you have but to name it.’ "
13.0,148,text_content,"blade beard. Deliberately he bent over the end of the table, spat on its polished surface. "
13.0,149,text_content,"As the men around the table started to surge to their feet, Idaho’s voice boomed across the room: ‘Hold!’ "
13.0,150,text_content,in the spirit with which it is given.’ And Idaho spat on the table in front of the Duke. 
13.0,151,text_content,"Aside to the Duke, he said: ‘Remember how precious water is here, Sire. That was a token of respect.’ "
13.0,152,text_content,the table as understanding came to his men. 
13.0,153,text_content,Duke?’ 
13.0,154,text_content,"‘He’s asking me to enlist with him, Sire,’ Idaho said. "
13.0,155,text_content,‘Would he accept a dual allegiance?’ Leto asked. 
13.0,156,text_content,"‘You wish me to go with him, Sire?’ "
13.0,157,text_content,"‘I wish you to make your own decision in the matter,’ Leto said, and he could not keep the urgency out of his voice. "
13.0,158,text_content,serve my Duke.’ 
13.0,159,text_content,be done. He will be Fremen and soldier of the Atreides. There is precedent for this: Liet serves two masters.’ 
13.0,160,text_content,‘Duncan?’ Leto asked. 
13.0,161,text_content,"‘I understand, Sire,’ Idaho said. "
13.0,162,text_content,"‘It is agreed, then,’ Leto said. "
13.0,163,text_content,It is a bond between us.’ 
13.0,164,text_content,"Leto sighed, glanced at Hawat, catching the old Mentat’s eye. Hawat nodded, his expression pleased. "
13.0,165,text_content,that when it comes time to release his spirit. You are friends of Turok.’ 
13.0,166,text_content,Stilgar started to turn away. 
13.0,167,text_content,‘Will you not stay a while?’ Leto asked. 
13.0,168,text_content,what looked like a thin tube before the veil settled into place. 
13.0,169,text_content,‘Is there reason to stay?’ the Fremen asked. 
13.0,170,text_content,"‘We would honor you,’ the Duke said. "
13.0,171,text_content,the door guards. 
13.0,172,text_content,"‘If the other Fremen match him, we’ll serve each other well,’ Leto said. "
13.0,173,text_content,"Idaho spoke in a dry voice: ‘He’s a fair sample, Sire.’ "
13.0,174,text_content,"‘You understand what you’re to do, Duncan?’ "
13.0,175,text_content,"‘I’m your ambassador to the Fremen, Sire.’ "
13.0,176,text_content,us.’ 
13.0,177,text_content,says there’s a Harkonnen reward of a million Solaris for anyone who’ll bring in a single crysknife.’ 
13.0,178,text_content,Leto’s chin came up in a movement of obvious surprise. ‘Why do they want one of those blades so badly?’ 
13.0,179,text_content,any sietch in the land. They’d question me unless I were known. I don’t look Fremen. But …’ 
13.0,180,text_content,"‘Piter de Vries,’ the Duke said. "
13.0,181,text_content,"‘A man of devilish cunning, my Lord,’ Hawat said. "
13.0,182,text_content,Idaho slipped the sheathed knife beneath his tunic. 
13.0,183,text_content,"‘Guard that knife,’ the Duke said. "
13.0,184,text_content,"Use battle language.’ He saluted, spun about, and hurried after the Fremen. "
13.0,185,text_content,They heard his footsteps drumming down the corridor. 
13.0,186,text_content,"A look of understanding passed between Leto and Hawat, They smiled. "
13.0,187,text_content,"‘We’ve much to do, Sire,’ Halleck said. "
13.0,188,text_content,"‘And I keep you from your work,’ Leto said. "
13.0,189,text_content,"‘I have the report on the advance bases,’ Hawat said. ‘Shall I give it another time, Sire?’ "
13.0,190,text_content,‘Will it take long?’ 
13.0,191,text_content,were sealed off before being abandoned.’ 
13.0,192,text_content,‘Equipment in them?’ the Duke asked. 
13.0,193,text_content,‘According to the reports I have from Duncan.’ 
13.0,194,text_content,‘Where are they located?’ Halleck said. 
13.0,195,text_content,"‘The answer to that question,’ Hawat said, ‘is invariably: “Liet knows.” ’ "
13.0,196,text_content,"‘God knows,’ Leto muttered. "
13.0,197,text_content,"‘Perhaps not, Sire,’ Hawat said. ‘You heard this Stilgar use the name. Could he have been referring to a real person?’ "
13.0,198,text_content,"‘Serving two masters,’ Halleck said. ‘It sounds like a religious quotation.’ "
13.0,199,text_content,"‘And you should know,’ the Duke said. "
13.0,200,text_content,Halleck smiled. 
13.0,201,text_content,"‘This Judge of the Change,’ Leto said, ‘the Imperial ecologist – Kynes … Wouldn’t he know where those bases are?’ "
13.0,202,text_content,"‘Sire,’ Hawat cautioned, ‘this Kynes is an Imperial servant.’ "
13.0,203,text_content,use for repair of our working equipment.’ 
13.0,204,text_content,‘Sire!’ Hawat said. ‘Those bases are still legally His Majesty’s fief.’ 
13.0,205,text_content,at least find out if the bases exist.’ 
13.0,206,text_content,"‘ ’Twere dangerous to commandeer them,’ Hawat said. ‘Duncan was clear on one thing: those bases or the idea of them hold some deep significance for the Fremen. We might alienate the Fremen if we took those bases.’ "
13.0,207,text_content,disturbed by his father’s attitude. 
13.0,208,text_content,"‘Listen to him, Father,’ Paul said in a low voice. ‘He speaks truth.’ "
13.0,209,text_content,mustn’t forget that. And the Fremen defer to him.’ 
13.0,210,text_content,"‘Do it gently, then,’ the Duke said. ‘I wish to know only if those bases exist.’ "
13.0,211,text_content,"‘As you will, Sire.’ Hawat sat back, lowered his eyes. "
13.0,212,text_content,"‘Gurney, take care of that smuggler situation first.’ "
13.0,213,text_content,"‘ “I shall go unto the rebellious that dwell in the dry land,”’ Halleck intoned. "
13.0,214,text_content,"‘Someday I’ll catch that man without a quotation and he’ll look undressed,’ the Duke said. "
13.0,215,text_content,"Chuckles echoed around the table, but Paul heard the effort in them. "
13.0,216,text_content,"have them ready, I’ll want to see you.’ "
13.0,217,text_content,"moved hurriedly, scraping their chairs on the floor, balling up in little knots of confusion. "
13.0,218,text_content,"had just seemed to trickle out, worn down by its own inadequacies, and with an argument to top it off.’ "
13.0,219,text_content,"or because of warnings such as that of the old Reverend Mother, but facing up to it because of his own assessment of the situation. "
13.0,220,text_content,"‘My father is desperate,’ he thought. ‘Things aren’t going well for us at all.’ "
13.0,221,text_content,"And Hawat – Paul recalled how the old Mentat had acted during the conference – subtle hesitations, signs of unrest. "
13.0,222,text_content,Hawat was deeply troubled by something. 
13.0,223,text_content,"got to his feet, slowly, stiffly. ‘Why don’t you pull a few of these chairs together and stretch out on them for some rest.’ "
13.0,224,text_content,"‘I’m not very tired, sir.’ "
13.0,225,text_content,‘As you will.’ 
13.0,226,text_content,"The Duke folded his hands behind him, began pacing up and down the length of the table. "
13.0,227,text_content,"‘Like a caged animal,’ Paul thought. "
13.0,228,text_content,‘Are you going to discuss the traitor possibility with Hawat?’ Paul asked. 
13.0,229,text_content,"The Duke stopped across from his son, spoke to the dark windows. ‘We’ve discussed the possibility many times.’ "
13.0,230,text_content,"‘The old woman seemed so sure of herself,’ Paul said. ‘And the message Mother—’ "
13.0,231,text_content,"the room, nodding shortly to the door guards. "
13.0,232,text_content,"the old woman’s warning: ‘… for the father, nothing.’ "
14.0,1,opening_text,had heard she was a Bene Gesserit and it was obvious to them that she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib. 
14.0,2,opening_caption,—from ‘Manual of Muad’Dib’ by the Princess Irulan 
14.0,3,text_content,"the Harkonnen ‘‘H’’ had been hastily removed, leaving an imperfect color patch. "
14.0,4,text_content,"‘The chairs are liberated but quite safe,’ Hawat said. ‘Where is Paul, Sire?’ "
14.0,5,text_content,‘I left him in the conference room. I’m hoping he’ll get some rest without me there to distract him.’ 
14.0,6,text_content,"Hawat nodded, crossed to the door to the adjoining room, closed it, shutting off the noise of static and electronic sparking. "
14.0,7,text_content,"‘Thufir,’ Leto said, ‘the Imperial and Harkonnen stockpiles of spice attract my attention.’ "
14.0,8,text_content,‘M’Lord?’ 
14.0,9,text_content,which he cannot openly admit that he has?’ 
14.0,10,text_content,"Hawat shook his head. ‘We’ve few men to spare, Sire.’ "
14.0,11,text_content,"tactical advantages to such a diversion, Thufir.’ "
14.0,12,text_content,"‘As you say, my Lord.’ Hawat turned away, and the Duke saw evidence of nervousness in the old man, thought: ‘Perhaps he suspects I distrust him. He must know I’ve private reports of traitors. Well – best quiet his fears immediately.’ "
14.0,13,text_content,"‘Thufir,’ he said, ‘since you’re one of the few I can trust completely, there’s another matter bears discussion. We both know how constant a watch we must keep to prevent traitors from infiltrating our forces … but I have two new reports.’ "
14.0,14,text_content,"Hawat turned, stared at him. "
14.0,15,text_content,And Leto repeated the stories Paul had brought. 
14.0,16,text_content,"Instead of bringing on the intense Mentat concentration, the reports only increased Hawat’s agitation. "
14.0,17,text_content,you were so nervous during Staff. What is it that was too hot to dump in front of the full conference?’ 
14.0,18,text_content,"their wrinkled stiffness as he said: ‘My Lord, I don’t quite know how to broach this.’ "
14.0,19,text_content,"‘We’ve suffered many a scar for each other, Thufir,’ the Duke said. ‘You know you can broach ‘any’ subject with me.’ "
14.0,20,text_content,"Hawat continued to stare at him, thinking: ‘This is how I like him best. This is the man of honor who deserves every bit of my loyalty and service. Why must I hurt him?’ "
14.0,21,text_content,‘Well?’ Leto demanded. 
14.0,22,text_content,great consequence or no consequence. It’s susceptible to various interpretations.’ 
14.0,23,text_content,‘What’s the delicate content of this note?’ 
14.0,24,text_content,"acid action just short of full erasure, leaving only a fragment. The fragment, however, is extremely suggestive.’ "
14.0,25,text_content,‘Yes?’ 
14.0,26,text_content,alone should be enough to destroy him.” The note was under the Baron’s own seal and I’ve authenticated the seal.’ 
14.0,27,text_content,"Your suspicion is obvious,’ the Duke said and his voice was suddenly cold. "
14.0,28,text_content,"‘I’d sooner cut off my arms than hurt you,’ Hawat said. ‘My Lord, what if …’ "
14.0,29,text_content,"‘The Lady Jessica,’ Leto said, and he felt anger consuming him. ‘Couldn’t you wring the facts out of this Pardee?’ "
14.0,30,text_content,what he carried.’ 
14.0,31,text_content,‘I see.’ 
14.0,32,text_content,"Leto shook his head, thinking: ‘What a slimy piece of business. There can’t be anything in it. I know my woman.’ "
14.0,33,text_content,"‘My Lord, if—’ "
14.0,34,text_content,‘No!’ the Duke barked. ‘There’s a mistake here that—’ 
14.0,35,text_content,"‘We cannot ignore it, my Lord.’ "
14.0,36,text_content,the woman!’ 
14.0,37,text_content,Hawat spoke bitterly: ‘Things have been known to escape me.’ 
14.0,38,text_content,"‘It’s impossible, I tell you! The Harkonnens want to destroy the Atreides ‘line –’ meaning Paul, too. They’ve already tried once. Could a woman conspire against her own son?’ "
14.0,39,text_content,‘Perhaps she doesn’t conspire against her son. And yesterday’s attempt could’ve been a clever sham.’ 
14.0,40,text_content,‘It couldn’t have been sham.’ 
14.0,41,text_content,Atreides?’ 
14.0,42,text_content,‘She’d have moved long before now. Poison in my drink … a stiletto at night. Who has had better opportunity?’ 
14.0,43,text_content,among vendettas.’ 
14.0,44,text_content,"The Duke’s shoulders slumped. He closed his eyes, looking old and tired. ‘It cannot be,’ he thought. ‘The woman has opened her heart to me.’ "
14.0,45,text_content,‘What better way to destroy me than to sow suspicion of the woman I love?’ he asked. 
14.0,46,text_content,"‘An interpretation I’ve considered,’ Hawat said. ‘Still …’ "
14.0,47,text_content,"The Duke opened his eyes, stared at Hawat, thinking: ‘Let him be suspicious. Suspicion is his trade, not mine. Perhaps if I appear to believe this, that will make another man careless.’ "
14.0,48,text_content,‘What do you suggest?’ the Duke whispered. 
14.0,49,text_content,Idaho’s troop who might be ideal to send to the Fremen as a replacement. He’s gifted in diplomacy.’ 
14.0,50,text_content,‘Don’t jeopardize our foothold with the Fremen.’ 
14.0,51,text_content,"‘Of course not, Sire.’ "
14.0,52,text_content,‘And what about Paul?’ 
14.0,53,text_content,‘Perhaps we could alert Dr Yueh.’ 
14.0,54,text_content,Leto turned his back on Hawat. ‘I leave it in your hands.’ 
14.0,55,text_content,"‘I shall use discretion, my Lord.’ "
14.0,56,text_content,"‘At least I can count on that,’ Leto thought. And he said: ‘I will take a walk. If you need me, I’ll be within the perimeter. The guard can—’ "
14.0,57,text_content,recall you asked me to report on it.’ 
14.0,58,text_content,"The Duke paused, spoke without turning. ‘Will it not wait?’ "
14.0,59,text_content,When they—’ 
14.0,60,text_content,‘At Paul?’ 
14.0,61,text_content,to true freedom. It follows the familiar messiah pattern.’ 
14.0,62,text_content,‘They think Paul is this … this …’ 
14.0,63,text_content,"‘They only hope, my Lord.’ Hawat extended a filmclip capsule. "
14.0,64,text_content,"The Duke accepted it, thrust it into a pocket. ‘I’ll look at it later.’ "
14.0,65,text_content,"‘Certainly, my Lord.’ "
14.0,66,text_content,"‘Right now, I need time to … think.’ "
14.0,67,text_content,"‘Yes, my Lord.’ "
14.0,68,text_content,and stood aside for him. 
14.0,69,text_content,to attention. 
14.0,70,text_content,"‘At ease,’ the Duke murmured. He leaned against the cold metal of the balcony rail. "
14.0,71,text_content,him with a cynical light. 
14.0,72,text_content,he experienced a chill. He shivered. 
14.0,73,text_content,Anger shot through him. 
14.0,74,text_content,"‘The Harkonnens have hindered and hounded and hunted me for the last time,’ he thought. ‘They are dung heaps with village provost minds! Here I make my stand! And’ he thought with a touch of sadness: ‘I must rule with eye and claw – as the hawk among lesser birds.’ Unconsciously, his hand brushed the hawk emblem on his tunic. "
14.0,75,text_content,bell-tolling movement of dawn striking across a broken horizon. 
14.0,76,text_content,It was a scene of such beauty it caught all his attention. 
14.0,77,text_content,"‘Some things beggar likeness,’ he thought. "
14.0,78,text_content,tread of violet … like giant footsteps. 
14.0,79,text_content,"‘It’s a beautiful morning, Sire,’ the guard said. "
14.0,80,text_content,"‘Yes, it is.’ "

16.0,46,text_content,"‘Shouldn’t we be going, Sire?’ Halleck asked. "

16.0,53,text_content,"The Duke lifted his arms at a gesture, said: ‘Most interesting.’ "

16.0,59,text_content,"‘A thimbleful a day,’ the Duke said. "
16.0,60,text_content,I could slip-patch it a bit tighter.’ 
16.0,61,text_content,– tighter and less irritating. 
16.0,62,text_content,"Kynes turned to Paul. ‘Now, let’s have a look at you, lad.’ "

16.0,65,text_content,"Kynes straightened, stepped back with a puzzled expression. ‘You’ve worn a stillsuit before?’ he asked. "

16.0,70,text_content,‘It … seemed the right way.’ 
16.0,71,text_content,‘That it most certainly is.’ 
16.0,72,text_content,"And Kynes rubbed his cheek, thinking of the legend: ‘‘He shall know your ways as though born to them.’’ "
16.0,73,text_content,"He climbed in, fastened his safety harness, checked controls and instruments. The craft creaked as the others clambered aboard. "
16.0,74,text_content,"instruments, the sensation of filtered and washed air in his lungs as doors slammed and vent fans whirred alive. "
16.0,75,text_content,‘So soft!’ he thought.

16.0,77,text_content,"and afterjets thrusting them upward in a steep, hissing climb. "
16.0,78,text_content,"‘Southeast over the Shield Wall,’ Kynes said. ‘That’s where I told your sandmaster to concentrate his equipment.’ "
16.0,79,text_content,‘Right.’ 
16.0,80,text_content,"The Duke banked into his air cover, the other craft taking up their guard positions as they headed southeast. "
16.0,81,text_content,"‘The design and manufacture of these stillsuits bespeaks a high degree of sophistication,’ the Duke said. "
16.0,82,text_content,"‘Someday I may show you a sietch factory,’ Kynes said. "
16.0,83,text_content,"‘I would find that interesting,’ the Duke said. ‘I note that suits are manufactured also in some of the garrison cities.’ "
16.0,84,text_content,"‘Inferior copies,’ Kynes said. ‘Any Dune man who values his skin wears a Fremen suit.’ "

16.0,91,text_content,"‘The Harkonnens left; you came,’ Kynes said. "

16.0,94,text_content,The Duke smiled grimly. ‘But we both know the realities.’ 
16.0,95,text_content,‘I remind you that His Majesty supports my work.’ 
16.0,96,text_content,‘Indeed? And what is your work?’ 
16.0,97,text_content,"In the brief silence, Paul thought: ‘He’s pushing this Kynes too hard.’ Paul glanced at Halleck, but the minstrel-warrior was staring out at the barren landscape. "
16.0,98,text_content,"Kynes spoke stiffly: ‘You, of course, refer to my duties as planetologist.’ "
16.0,99,text_content,‘Of course.’ 
16.0,100,text_content,possibilities of an entire planet.’ 
16.0,101,text_content,‘Do you also investigate the spice?’ 
16.0,102,text_content,"Kynes turned, and Paul noted the hard line of the man’s cheek. ‘A curious question, my Lord.’ "
16.0,103,text_content,"of the spice, didn’t they?’ "
16.0,104,text_content,Kynes stared back without answering. 
16.0,105,text_content,"‘You may speak plainly,’ the Duke said, ‘without fear for your skin.’ "
16.0,106,text_content,"‘The Imperial Court is, indeed, a long way off,’ Kynes muttered. And he thought: ‘What does this water-soft invader expect? Does he think me fool enough to enlist with him?’ "
16.0,107,text_content,"our mob of tame killers, eh? And we expect you to realize immediately that we’re different from the Harkonnens?’ "
16.0,108,text_content,"‘I’ve read the propaganda you’ve flooded into sietch and village,’ Kynes said. ‘ “Love the good Duke!” Your corps of—’ "
16.0,109,text_content,"‘Here now!’ Halleck barked. He snapped his attention away from the window, leaned forward. "
16.0,110,text_content,Paul put a hand on Halleck’s arm. 
16.0,111,text_content,‘Gurney!’ the Duke said. He glanced back. ‘This man’s been long under the Harkonnens.’ 
16.0,112,text_content,Halleck sat back. ‘Ayah.’ 
16.0,113,text_content,"‘Your man Hawat’s subtle,’ Kynes said, ‘but his object’s plain enough.’ "
16.0,114,text_content,"‘Will you open those bases to us, then?’ the Duke asked. "
16.0,115,text_content,Kynes spoke curtly: ‘They’re His Majesty’s property.’ 
16.0,116,text_content,‘They’re not being used.’ 
16.0,117,text_content,‘They could be used.’ 
16.0,118,text_content,‘Does His Majesty concur?’ 
16.0,119,text_content,Kynes darted a hard stare at the Duke. ‘Arrakis could be an Eden if its rulers would look up from grubbing for spice!’ 
16.0,120,text_content,"‘He didn’t answer my question,’ the Duke thought. And he said: ‘How is a planet to become an Eden without money?’ "
16.0,121,text_content,"‘What is money,’ Kynes asked, ‘if it won’t buy the services you need?’ "
16.0,122,text_content,Wall. Do I hold the same course?’ 
16.0,123,text_content,"‘The same course,’ Kynes muttered. "

16.0,125,text_content,‘Are there any plants down there?’ Paul asked. 
16.0,126,text_content,"under these rigors. If ‘you’ get caught down there, you imitate that life or you die.’ "
16.0,127,text_content,"‘You mean steal water from each other?’ Paul asked. The idea outraged him, and his voice betrayed his emotion. "
16.0,128,text_content,You are aware of water at all times. You waste nothing that contains moisture.’ 
16.0,129,text_content,And the Duke thought: ‘… ‘my climate!’’

16.0,132,text_content,"‘This should clear the storm’s edge,’ Kynes said. "

16.0,134,text_content,"‘At this altitude, it’s not sand but dust,’ Kynes said. ‘The danger is lack of visibility, turbulence, clogged intakes.’ "
16.0,135,text_content,‘We’ll see actual spice mining today?’ Paul asked. 
16.0,136,text_content,"‘Very likely,’ Kynes said. "

16.0,138,text_content,around as Halleck tuned the instrument then returned his attention to their course.

16.0,140,text_content,"‘You choose, Gurney,’ Paul said. "
16.0,141,text_content,"Halleck bent his ear close to the sounding board, strummed a chord and sang softly: "

16.0,146,text_poem,From the dry and thirsty land.’ 
16.0,147,text_content,"Kynes glanced at the Duke, said: ‘You ‘do’ travel with a light complement of guards, my Lord. Are all of them such men of many talents?’ "
16.0,148,text_content,‘Gurney?’ The Duke chuckled. ‘Gurney’s one of a kind. I like him with me for his eyes. His eyes miss very little.’ 
16.0,149,text_content,The planetologist frowned. 
16.0,150,text_content,"Without missing a beat in his tune, Halleck interposed: "

16.0,154,text_content,"‘It’s merely a bird,’ Kynes said, and added: You have sharp eyes.’ "
16.0,155,text_content,"The panel speaker crackled, then: ‘Escort Gemma. Object examined under full amplification. It’s a large bird.’ "
16.0,156,text_content,father must be. Every sense was at full alert. 
16.0,157,text_content,"‘I’d not realized there were birds that large this far into the desert,’ the Duke said. "

16.0,159,text_content,"shadow of their craft and escort. The land beneath seemed flat, but shadow wrinkles said otherwise. "
16.0,160,text_content,‘Has anyone ever walked out of the desert?’ the Duke asked. 
16.0,161,text_content,Halleck’s music stopped. He leaned forward to catch the answer. 
16.0,162,text_content,the rock areas where worms seldom go.’ 
16.0,163,text_content,The timbre of Kynes’ voice held Paul’s attention. He felt his senses come alert the way they were trained to do. 
16.0,164,text_content,"‘Ah-h, the worms,’ the Duke said. ‘I must see one sometime.’ "
16.0,165,text_content,"‘You may see one today,’ Kynes said. ‘Wherever there is spice, there are worms.’ "
16.0,166,text_content,‘Always?’ Halleck asked. 
16.0,167,text_content,‘Always.’ 
16.0,168,text_content,‘Is there relationship between worm and spice?’ the Duke asked. 
16.0,169,text_content,you my monograph on the subject.’ 
16.0,170,text_content,‘And a shield’s no defense?’ the Duke asked. 
16.0,171,text_content,from far around to attack a shield. No man wearing a shield has ever survived such attack.’ 
16.0,172,text_content,"‘How are worms taken, then?’ "
16.0,173,text_content,"atomics, I know of no explosive powerful enough to destroy a large worm entirely. They’re incredibly tough.’ "
16.0,174,text_content,‘Why hasn’t an effort been made to wipe them out?’ Paul asked. 
16.0,175,text_content,"‘Too expensive,’ Kynes said. ‘Too much area to cover.’ "
16.0,176,text_content,"And he thought: ‘If there’s a relationship between spice and worms, killing the worms would destroy the spice.’ "
16.0,177,text_content,is on its way. All our workers will be wearing them before long. We’re setting up a special rescue service.’ 
16.0,178,text_content,"‘Very commendable,’ Kynes said. "
16.0,179,text_content,"‘Your tone says you don’t agree,’ the Duke said. "
16.0,180,text_content,"much time. Frequently, you have no more than fifteen or twenty minutes.’ "
16.0,181,text_content,‘What would you advise?’ the Duke asked. 
16.0,182,text_content,‘You ask my advice?’ 
16.0,183,text_content,"‘As planetologist, yes.’ "
16.0,184,text_content,‘You’d follow my advice?’ 
16.0,185,text_content,‘If I found it sensible.’ 
16.0,186,text_content,"‘Very well, my Lord. Never travel alone.’ "
16.0,187,text_content,The Duke turned his attention from the controls. ‘That’s all?’ 
16.0,188,text_content,‘That’s all. Never travel alone.’ 
16.0,189,text_content,‘What if you’re separated by a storm and forced down?’ Halleck asked. ‘Isn’t there anything you could do?’ 
16.0,190,text_content,"‘‘Anything’ covers much territory,’ Kynes said. "
16.0,191,text_content,‘What would ‘you’ do?’ Paul asked. 
16.0,192,text_content,"the ship, but it might miss me.’ "
16.0,193,text_content,‘Then what?’ Halleck asked. 
16.0,194,text_content,Kynes shrugged. ‘Wait for the worm to leave.’ 
16.0,195,text_content,‘That’s all?’ Paul asked. 
16.0,196,text_content,– head for the nearest rock zone. There are many such zones. You might make it.’ 
16.0,197,text_content,‘Drum sand?’ Halleck asked. 
16.0,198,text_content,"‘A condition of sand compaction,’ Kynes said. ‘The slightest step sets it drumming. Worms always come to that.’ "
16.0,199,text_content,‘And a tidal dust basin?’ the Duke asked.

16.0,209,text_content,‘That’s what we seek.’ Kynes said. 
16.0,210,text_content,"Paul stretched up in the seat to peer ahead, saw a rolling yellow cloud low on the desert surface some thirty kilometers ahead. "
16.0,211,text_content,expelled after the spice has been centrifugally removed. There’s no other cloud quite like it.’ 
16.0,212,text_content,"‘Aircraft over it,’ the Duke said. "
16.0,213,text_content,"‘I see two … three … four spotters,’ Kynes said. ‘They’re watching for wormsign.’ "
16.0,214,text_content,‘Wormsign?’ the Duke asked. 
16.0,215,text_content,"the wave to show.’ Kynes swung his gaze around the sky. ‘Should be a carryall wing around, but I don’t see it.’ "
16.0,216,text_content,"‘The worm always comes, eh?’ Halleck asked. "
16.0,217,text_content,‘Always.’ 
16.0,218,text_content,"Paul leaned forward, touched Kynes’ shoulder. ‘How big an area does each worm stake out?’ "
16.0,219,text_content,Kynes frowned. The child kept asking adult questions. 
16.0,220,text_content,‘That depends on the size of the worm.’ 
16.0,221,text_content,‘What’s the variation?’ the Duke asked. 
16.0,222,text_content,crawler. 
16.0,223,text_content,‘Is that wormsign?’ 
16.0,224,text_content,Kynes leaned across the Duke to peer into the distance. 
16.0,225,text_content,"maneuver, had surged ahead, but now was curving back. The factory crawler lay ahead of them, still some three kilometers away. "
16.0,226,text_content,fish disturbed the water when swimming just under the surface. 
16.0,227,text_content,"Wormsign warning. Crawler at Delta Ajax niner. Wormsign warning. Acknowledge, please.’ He waited. "
16.0,228,text_content,"The panel speaker emitted static crackles, then a voice: ‘Who calls Delta Ajax niner? Over.’ "
16.0,229,text_content,"‘They seem pretty calm about it,’ Halleck said. "
16.0,230,text_content,"course, your position, estimated contact twenty-five minutes.’ "
16.0,231,text_content,"a pause, then: ‘Contact in twenty-six minutes minus. That was a sharp estimate. Who’s on that unlisted flight? Over.’ "
16.0,232,text_content,"Halleck had his harness off and surged forward between Kynes and the Duke. ‘Is this the regular working frequency, Kynes?’ "
16.0,233,text_content,‘Yes. Why?’ 
16.0,234,text_content,‘Who’d be listening?’ 
16.0,235,text_content,‘Just the work crews in this area. Cuts down interference.’ 
16.0,236,text_content,"Again, the speaker crackled, then: ‘This is Delta Ajax niner. Who gets bonus credit for that spot? Over.’ "
16.0,237,text_content,Halleck glanced at the Duke. 
16.0,238,text_content,Kynes said: ‘There’s a bonus based on spice load for whoever gives first worm warning. They want to know—’ 
16.0,239,text_content,"‘Tell them who had first sight of that worm,’ Halleck said. "
16.0,240,text_content,The Duke nodded. 
16.0,241,text_content,"Kynes hesitated, then lifted the microphone: ‘Spotter credit to the Duke Leto Atreides. The Duke Leto Atreides. Over.’ "
16.0,242,text_content,The voice from the speaker was flat and partly distorted by a burst of static: ‘We read and thank you.’ 
16.0,243,text_content,"‘Now, tell them to divide the bonus among themselves,’ Halleck ordered. ‘Tell them it’s the Duke’s wish.’ "
16.0,244,text_content,"Kynes took a deep breath, then: ‘It’s the Duke’s wish that you divide the bonus among your crew. Do you read? Over.’ "
16.0,245,text_content,"Acknowledged and thank you,’ the speaker said. "
16.0,246,text_content,The Duke said: ‘I forgot to mention that Gurney is also very talented in public relations.’ 
16.0,247,text_content,Kynes turned a puzzled frown on Halleck. 
16.0,248,text_content,glanced out at their air cover. ‘And we’re a pretty strong force. It was a good risk.’ 
16.0,249,text_content,The Duke banked their craft toward the sandcloud erupting from the factory crawler. ‘What happens now?’ 
16.0,250,text_content,"‘There’s a carryall wing somewhere close,’ Kynes said. ‘It’ll come in and lift off the crawler.’ "
16.0,251,text_content,‘What if the carryall’s wrecked?’ Halleck asked. 
16.0,252,text_content,"‘Some equipment ‘is’ lost,’ Kynes said. ‘Get in close over the crawler, my Lord; you’ll find this interesting.’ "
16.0,253,text_content,"The Duke scowled, busied himself with the controls as they came into turbulent air over the crawler. "
16.0,254,text_content,front of it. 
16.0,255,text_content,"‘Rich spice bed by the color,’ Kynes said. ‘They’ll continue working until the last minute.’ "
16.0,256,text_content,crawler. A glance left and right showed his cover holding altitude and circling overhead. 
16.0,257,text_content,"Paul studied the yellow cloud belching from the crawler’s pipe vents, looked out over the desert at the approaching worm track. "
16.0,258,text_content,‘Shouldn’t we be hearing them call in the carryall?’ Halleck asked. 
16.0,259,text_content,"‘They usually have the wing on a different frequency,’ Kynes said. "
16.0,260,text_content,"machine down there, not to mention cost of equipment.’ "
16.0,261,text_content,Kynes said: ‘You don’t have enough ex—’ 
16.0,262,text_content,He broke off as the speaker erupted with an angry voice: ‘Any of you see the wing? He isn’t answering.’ 
16.0,263,text_content,"A garble of noise crackled from the speaker, drowned in an abrupt override signal, then silence and the first voice: ‘Report by the numbers! Over.’ "
16.0,264,text_content,"‘This is Spotter Control. Last I saw, the wing was pretty high and circling off northwest. I don’t see him now. Over.’ "
16.0,265,text_content,‘Spotter one: negative. Over.’ 
16.0,266,text_content,‘Spotter two: negative. Over.’ 
16.0,267,text_content,‘Spotter three: negative. Over.’ 
16.0,268,text_content,Silence. 
16.0,269,text_content,"The Duke looked down. His own craft’s shadow was just passing over the crawler. ‘Only four spotters, is that right?’ "
16.0,270,text_content,"‘Correct,’ Kynes said. "
16.0,271,text_content,to be able to lift off two each.’ 
16.0,272,text_content,"Paul did the mental arithmetic, said: ‘That’s three short.’ "
16.0,273,text_content,‘Why don’t they have two carryalls to each crawler?’ barked the Duke. 
16.0,274,text_content,"‘You don’t have enough extra equipment,’ Kynes said. "
16.0,275,text_content,‘All the more reason we should protect what we have!’ 
16.0,276,text_content,‘Where could that carryall go?’ Halleck asked. 
16.0,277,text_content,"‘Could’ve been forced down somewhere out of sight,’ Kynes said. "
16.0,278,text_content,"The Duke grabbed the microphone, hesitated with thumb poised over its switch. ‘How could they lose sight of a carryall?’ "
16.0,279,text_content,"‘They keep their attention on the ground looking for wormsign,’ Kynes said. "
16.0,280,text_content,"punched out his own command frequency, repeated the order for his own air cover, handed the microphone back to Kynes. "
16.0,281,text_content,a full load! We can’t leave that for a damned worm! Over.’ 
16.0,282,text_content,"‘Sorry,’ as Kynes shook an injured finger. "
16.0,283,text_content,‘How much time?’ Paul asked. 
16.0,284,text_content,"‘Nine minutes,’ Kynes said. "
16.0,285,text_content,in an additional man.’ 
16.0,286,text_content,"‘That sand’s soft,’ Kynes said. "
16.0,287,text_content,"‘With four extra men aboard on a jet takeoff, we could snap the wings, Sire,’ Halleck said. "
16.0,288,text_content,"tipped up, braked the ’thopter to a skidding stop within twenty meters of the factory. "
16.0,289,text_content,audible as the Duke opened his door. 
16.0,290,text_content,"Immediately, their nostrils were assailed by the odor of cinnamon – heavy and pungent. "
16.0,291,text_content,swooped in to land in line with him. 
16.0,292,text_content,"Paul, looking out at the factory, saw how all the ’thopters were dwarfed by it – gnats beside a warrior beetle. "
16.0,293,text_content,"angle, checked the jet pod controls. ‘Why the devil aren’t they coming out of that machine?’ "
16.0,294,text_content,"‘They’re hoping the carryall will show up,’ Kynes said. ‘They still have a few minutes.’ He glanced off to the east. "
16.0,295,text_content,the air. 
16.0,296,text_content,cut that crawler apart with a lasgun!’ 
16.0,297,text_content,then to the sand. 
16.0,298,text_content,"The Duke hung the microphone on the panel, swung out onto the wing step, shouted: ‘Two men each into your spotters.’ "
16.0,299,text_content,"The man in the patched robe began tolling off pairs of his crew, pushing them toward the craft waiting on the other side. "
16.0,300,text_content,"other escort that had shed its shield generator. ‘Three each into the others! Run, you sand dogs!’ "
16.0,301,text_content,"The tall man finished counting off his crew, came slogging across the sand followed by three of his companions. "
16.0,302,text_content,"‘I hear the worm, but I can’t see it,’ Kynes said. "
16.0,303,text_content,"The others heard it then – an abrasive slithering, distant and growing louder. "
16.0,304,text_content,"‘Damn sloppy way to operate,’ the Duke muttered. "
16.0,305,text_content,"into a clearing, and carrion birds lifting away from the carcass of a wild ox. "
16.0,306,text_content,into the rear. 
16.0,307,text_content,"‘In you go, boys!’ he snapped. ‘On the double!’ "
16.0,308,text_content,on their stillsuits. He filed the information in his memory for future action. His father would have to order tighter 
16.0,309,text_content,stillsuit discipline. Men tended to become sloppy if you didn’t watch such things. 
16.0,310,text_content,"The last man came gasping into the rear, said: ‘The worm! It’s almost on us! Blast off!’ "
16.0,311,text_content,"right, Kynes?’ He shut his door, checked it. "
16.0,312,text_content,"‘Almost exactly, my Lord,’ Kynes said, and he thought: ‘A cool one, this duke.’ "
16.0,313,text_content,"‘All secure here, Sire,’ Halleck said. "
16.0,314,text_content,punched the jet sequence. 
16.0,315,text_content,left and right at his wings. 
16.0,316,text_content,"‘She’s very heavy, Sire,’ Halleck said. "
16.0,317,text_content,"‘Well within the tolerances of this ship,’ the Duke said. ‘You didn’t really think I’d risk this cargo, did you Gurney?’ "
16.0,318,text_content,"Halleck grinned, said: ‘Not a bit of it, Sire.’ "
16.0,319,text_content,The Duke banked his craft in a long easy curve – climbing over the crawler. 
16.0,320,text_content,"four hundred meters from the crawler. And now, there appeared to be turbulence in the sand around the factory. "
16.0,321,text_content,"‘The worm is now beneath the crawler,’ Kynes said. ‘You are about to witness a thing few have seen.’ "
16.0,322,text_content,of meters around. 
16.0,323,text_content,Then they saw it! 
16.0,324,text_content,sand. The hole pulled back. 
16.0,325,text_content,"‘Gods, what a monster!’ muttered a man beside Paul. "
16.0,326,text_content,‘Got all our floggin’ spice!’ growled another. 
16.0,327,text_content,"‘Someone is going to pay for this,’ the Duke said. ‘I promise you that.’ "
16.0,328,text_content,"By the very flatness of his father’s voice, Paul sensed the deep anger. He found that he shared it. This was criminal waste! "
16.0,329,text_content,"In the silence that followed, they heard Kynes. "
16.0,330,text_content,He keep the world for His people.’ 
16.0,331,text_content,‘What’s that you’re saying?’ the Duke asked. 
16.0,332,text_content,But Kynes remained silent. 
16.0,333,text_content,‘Liet.’ 
16.0,334,text_content,"Kynes turned, scowling. The man sank back, abashed. "
16.0,335,text_content,"Another of the rescued men began coughing – dry and rasping. Presently, he gasped: ‘Curse this hell hole!’ "
16.0,336,text_content,to you we give thanks for our lives. We were ready to end it there until you came along.’ 
16.0,337,text_content,"‘Quiet, man, and let the Duke fly his ship,’ Halleck muttered. "
16.0,338,text_content,the Duke was in a rage. 
16.0,339,text_content,depression. They appeared to glide over the surface with hardly a lifting of dust to mark their passage. 
16.0,340,text_content,‘Who’s that down there?’ the Duke barked. 
16.0,341,text_content,"‘Two Johnnies who came along for the ride, Soor,’ said the tall Dune man. "
16.0,342,text_content,‘Why wasn’t something said about them?’ 
16.0,343,text_content,"‘It was the chance they took, Soor,’ the Dune man said. "
16.0,344,text_content,"‘My Lord,’ said Kynes, ‘these men know it’s of little use to do anything about men trapped on the desert in worm country.’ "
16.0,345,text_content,‘We’ll send a ship from base for them!’ the Duke snapped. 
16.0,346,text_content,"‘As you wish, my Lord,’ Kynes said. ‘But likely when the ship gets here there’ll be no one to rescue.’ "
16.0,347,text_content,"‘We’ll send a ship anyway,’ the Duke said. "
16.0,348,text_content,"‘They were right beside where the worm came up,’ Paul said. ‘How’d they escape?’ "
16.0,349,text_content,"‘The sides of the hole cave in and make the distances deceptive,’ Kynes said. "
16.0,350,text_content,"‘You waste fuel here, Sire,’ Halleck ventured. "
16.0,351,text_content,"‘Aye, Gurney.’ "
16.0,352,text_content,on both sides. 
16.0,353,text_content,"across the surface so surely, moving in a way obviously calculated to keep from luring the worm back out of its depths. "
16.0,354,text_content,‘Fremen!’ Paul thought. ‘Who else would be so sure on the sand? Who else might be left out of your worries as a matter of course – because’ they ‘are in no danger?’ They ‘know how to live here!’ They ‘know how to outwit the worm!’ 
16.0,355,text_content,What were Fremen doing on that crawler?’ Paul asked. 
16.0,356,text_content,Kynes whirled. 
16.0,357,text_content,The tall Dune man turned wide eyes on Paul – blue within blue within blue. ‘Who be this lad?’ he asked. 
16.0,358,text_content,"Halleck moved to place himself between the man and Paul, said: ‘This is Paul Atreides, the ducal heir.’ "
16.0,359,text_content,Why says he there were Fremen on our rumbler?’ the man asked. 
16.0,360,text_content,"‘They fit the description,’ Paul said. "
16.0,361,text_content,Kynes snorted. ‘You can’t tell Fremen just by looking at them!’ He looked at the Dune man. ‘You. Who were those men?’ 
16.0,362,text_content,"‘Friends of one of the others,’ the Dune man said. ‘Just friends from a village who wanted to see the spice sands.’ "
16.0,363,text_content,Kynes turned away. Fremen!’ 
16.0,364,text_content,But he was remembering the words of the legend: ‘‘The Lisan al-Gaib shall see through all subterfuge.’’ 
16.0,365,text_content,"‘They be dead now, most likely, young Soor,’ the Dune man said. ‘We should not speak unkindly on them.’ "
16.0,366,text_content,"But Paul heard the falsehood in their voices, felt the menace that had brought Halleck instinctively into guarding position. "
16.0,367,text_content,Paul spoke dryly: ‘A terrible place for them to die.’ 
16.0,368,text_content,to direct him to that place.’ 
16.0,369,text_content,Leto turned a hard stare at Kynes. 
16.0,370,text_content,as that would command fanatic loyalty. He would be difficult to defeat.’ 
16.0,371,text_content,"Against his own will and all previous judgments, Kynes admitted to himself: ‘I like this duke.’ "

17.0,10,text_content,‘The custom stops here!’ he muttered. 
17.0,11,text_content,"him, and he noted the leathery face, the blue-within-blue eyes. "
17.0,12,text_content,"‘My Lord wishes?’ She kept her head bowed, eyes shielded. "
17.0,13,text_content,He gestured. ‘Have these basins and towels removed.’

17.0,27,text_content,The Duke glanced around the room. 
17.0,28,text_content,all equally with an air of reserved nobility. 
17.0,29,text_content,"‘He’ll wear the title well,’ the Duke thought, and realized with a sudden chill that this was another death thought. "

17.0,31,text_content,but his father had been firm. ‘You have a place – a position to uphold. You’re old enough to do this. You’re almost a man.’ 
17.0,32,text_content,"Paul saw his father emerge from the doorway, inspect the room, then cross to the group around the Lady Jessica. "
17.0,33,text_content,"As Leto approached Jessica’s group, the water-shipper was asking: ‘Is it true the Duke will put in weather control?’ "
17.0,34,text_content,"From behind the man, the Duke said: ‘We haven’t gone that far in our thinking, sir.’ "
17.0,35,text_content,"‘The man turned, exposing a bland round face, darkly tanned. ‘Ah-h, the Duke,’ he said. ‘We missed you.’ "
17.0,36,text_content,the old custom ends now.’ 
17.0,37,text_content,"‘Is this a ducal order, m’Lord?’ the man asked. "
17.0,38,text_content,"‘I leave that to your own … ah … conscience,’ the Duke said. He turned, noting Kynes come up to the group. "
17.0,39,text_content,One of the women said: ‘I think it’s a very generous gesture – giving water to the—’ Someone shushed her. 
17.0,40,text_content,Civil Servant and a tiny gold teardrop of rank at his collar. 
17.0,41,text_content,The water-shipper asked in an angry voice: ‘Does the Duke imply criticism of our custom?’ 
17.0,42,text_content,"‘This custom has been changed,’ Leto said. He nodded to Kynes, marked the frown on Jessica’s face, thought: ‘A frown does not become her, but it’ll increase rumors of friction between us.’ "
17.0,43,text_content,"‘With the Duke’s permission,’ the water-shipper said, ‘I’d like to inquire further about customs.’ "
17.0,44,text_content,to turn toward them around the room.

17.0,47,text_content,attached to this house. Do you intend to continue flaunting it in the people’s faces … m’Lord?’ 
17.0,48,text_content,at a signal … The man looked capable of such a thing. Destruction of water facilities might well destroy Arrakis. That could well have been the club this Bewt held over the Harkonnens. 
17.0,49,text_content,be changed sufficiently to grow such plants anywhere in the open.’ 
17.0,50,text_content,‘Bless her!’ Leto thought. ‘Let our water-shipper chew on that.’ 
17.0,51,text_content,water will not be a precious commodity on Arrakis.’ 
17.0,52,text_content,once. No man is going to hold a club over my head!’

17.0,55,text_content,Kynes’ thoughts were overwhelmed at last by the words of prophecy: ‘‘And they shall share your most precious dream.’’ He spoke directly to Jessica: ‘Do you bring the shortening of the way?’ 
17.0,56,text_content,"‘Ah, Dr Kynes,’ the water-shipper said. ‘You’ve come in from tramping around with your mobs of Fremen. How gracious of you.’ "

17.0,60,text_content,"‘Kwisatz Haderach,’ Jessica thought. ‘Did our Missionaria Protectiva plant that legend here, too?’ The thought fanned her secret hope for Paul. ‘He could be the Kwisatz Haderach. He could be.’ "

17.0,62,text_content,"The Duke saw how the words seemed to pierce Kynes, jerking the planetologist upright and away from the flirting woman. "

17.0,65,text_content,"too, my Lord?’ "
17.0,66,text_content,He spoke coldly: ‘That seems a goodly custom. We shall let it stand for now.’ 
17.0,67,text_content,"‘The illusion that I suspect her of treachery must be maintained,’ he thought. He glanced at the guests filing past them. ‘Who among you believes this lie?’ "
17.0,68,text_content,fact more firmly than this sort of social sharing.’ 
17.0,69,text_content,"Leto, watching the guests file past, recalled what Thufir Hawat had said when informed of the affair: ‘‘Sire! I forbid it!’’ "
17.0,70,text_content,That’s not like the Harkonnens. Not like them at all.’ 
17.0,71,text_content,at something the young woman said. 
17.0,72,text_content,of the man’s suits.’ 
17.0,73,text_content,‘Who’s the man with the scarred face ahead of Paul?’ the Duke asked. ‘I don’t place him.’ 
17.0,74,text_content,"‘A late addition to the list,’ she whispered. ‘Gurney arranged the invitation. Smuggler.’ "
17.0,75,text_content,‘Gurney arranged?’

17.0,79,text_content,you invite some Fremen?’ 
17.0,80,text_content,"‘There’s Kynes,’ she said. "
17.0,81,text_content,"‘Yes, there’s Kynes,’ he said. ‘Have you arranged any other little surprises for me?’ He led her into step behind the procession. "
17.0,82,text_content,"‘All else is most conventional,’ she said. "

17.0,84,text_content,"standing. He gave a hand signal, and the house troopers in footman uniform around the table stepped back, standing at attention. "
17.0,85,text_content,Uneasy silence settled over the room. 
17.0,86,text_content,"Jessica, looking down the length of the table, saw a faint trembling at the corners of Leto’s mouth, noted the dark flush of anger on his cheeks. ‘What has angered him?’ she asked herself. ‘Surely not my invitation to the smuggler.’ "
17.0,87,text_content,"‘Some question my changing of the laving basin custom,’ Leto said. ‘This is my way of telling you that many things will change.’ "
17.0,88,text_content,Embarrassed silence settled over the table. 
17.0,89,text_content,"‘They think him drunk,’ Jessica thought. "
17.0,90,text_content,"the Imperium, then,’ he said, ‘I give you a toast.’ "
17.0,91,text_content,in an errant breeze from the serving kitchen hallway. Shadows played across the Duke’s hawk features. 
17.0,92,text_content,‘Here I am and here I remain!’ he barked. 
17.0,93,text_content,of those maxims so dear to our hearts: “Business makes progress! Fortune passes everywhere!” ’ 
17.0,94,text_content,He sipped his water. 
17.0,95,text_content,The others joined him. Questioning glances passed among them. 
17.0,96,text_content,‘Gurney!’ the Duke called. 
17.0,97,text_content,"From an alcove at Leto’s end of the room came Halleck’s voice. ‘Here, my Lord.’ "

17.0,100,text_content,"Still, the Duke remained standing. "

17.0,102,text_content,An uncomfortable stirring sounded around the table.

17.0,108,text_content,Jessica was first to follow his example.

17.0,110,text_content,Dune 
17.0,111,text_content,trying to lift the mood. 
17.0,112,text_content,"‘Let the dinner commence,’ the Duke said, and sank into his chair. "
17.0,113,text_content,"like a desperate man.’ She lifted her fork, hoping in the motion to hide her own sudden bitterness. ‘Why not? He is desperate.’ "
17.0,114,text_content,on her chef and wine. 
17.0,115,text_content,"‘We brought both from Caladan,’ she said. "
17.0,116,text_content,everything.’ 
17.0,117,text_content,to a worm.’ 
17.0,118,text_content,"‘News travels fast,’ the Duke said. "
17.0,119,text_content,"‘Then it’s true?’ the banker asked, shifting his attention to Leto. "
17.0,120,text_content,to disappear!’ 
17.0,121,text_content,"‘When the worm came, there was nothing to recover the crawler,’ Kynes said. "
17.0,122,text_content,‘It should ‘not’ be possible!’ the Duke repeated. 
17.0,123,text_content,‘No one saw the carryall leave?’ the banker asked. 
17.0,124,text_content,foes—’ 
17.0,125,text_content,"‘A-h-h, I see,’ the banker said. And you, as Judge of the Change, do you challenge this?’ "
17.0,126,text_content,"‘I shall have to consider my position carefully,’ Kynes said, ‘and I certainly will not discuss it at table.’ And he thought: ‘That pale skeleton of a man! He knows this is the kind of infraction I was instructed to ignore.’ "
17.0,127,text_content,"The banker smiled, returned his attention to his food. "
17.0,128,text_content,"A plump, happy-faced Reverend Mother had been the lecturer, her jolly voice contrasting weirdly with the subject matter. "
17.0,129,text_content,"Any enclosed discipline sets its stamp, its pattern, upon its students. That pattern is susceptible to analysis and prediction.’ "

17.0,135,text_content,"face into a frown, said: ‘Oh, Soo-Soo, you say the most disgusting things.’ "
17.0,136,text_content,with such accuracy that many around the table laughed. 
17.0,137,text_content,"on his dinner. It came to Jessica that the banker had said: ‘‘I, too, control that ultimate source of power on Arrakis – water.’’ "
17.0,138,text_content,"Gesserit intensity. On impulse, he decided to play the foil, draw the exchange out. He addressed himself to the banker. "
17.0,139,text_content,"‘Do you mean, sir, that these birds are cannibals?’ "
17.0,140,text_content,"of their own kind, does it?’ "
17.0,141,text_content,"a bite of food from his companion’s plate, ate it. ‘They are eating from the same bowl. They have the same basic requirements.’ "
17.0,142,text_content,"The banker stiffened, scowled at the Duke. "
17.0,143,text_content,"‘Do not make the error of considering my son a child,’ the Duke said. And he smiled. "
17.0,144,text_content,"Jessica glanced around the table, noted that Bewt had brightened, that both Kynes and the smuggler, Tuek, were grinning. "
17.0,145,text_content,an efficient energy source.’ 
17.0,146,text_content,"The banker put down his fork, spoke in an angry voice: ‘It’s said that the Fremen scum drink the blood of their dead.’ "
17.0,147,text_content,"is composed of some seventy per cent water by weight. A dead man, surely, no longer requires that water.’ "
17.0,148,text_content,in a rage. 
17.0,149,text_content,and it needed clarifying.’ 
17.0,150,text_content,"‘You’ve associated so long with Fremen that you’ve lost all sensibilities,’ the banker rasped. "
17.0,151,text_content,"Kynes looked at him calmly, studied the pale, trembling face. ‘Are you challenging me, sir?’ "
17.0,152,text_content,"The banker froze. He swallowed, spoke stiffly: ‘Of course not. I’d not so insult our host and hostess.’ "
17.0,153,text_content,man was terrified of Kynes! 
17.0,154,text_content,people who understand defense of honor. We all may attest to their courage by the fact that they are here … now … on Arrakis.’ 
17.0,155,text_content,"smuggler, Tuek, who appeared to be watching Kynes for a cue. Jessica saw that Paul was looking at Kynes in admiration. "
17.0,156,text_content,‘Well?’ Kynes said. 
17.0,157,text_content,"‘I meant no offense,’ the banker muttered. ‘If offense was taken, please accept my apologies.’ "
17.0,158,text_content,"‘Freely given, freely accepted,’ Kynes said. He smiled at Jessica, resumed eating as though nothing had happened. "
17.0,159,text_content,to Kynes’ assistance. There existed an accord of some sort between Kynes and Tuek. 
17.0,160,text_content,of Atreides. Kynes had seemed colder on their trip over the desert. 
17.0,161,text_content,Jessica signaled for another course of food and drink. Servants appeared with ‘langues de lapins de garenne –’ red wine and a sauce of mushroom-yeast on the side. 
17.0,162,text_content,and she guessed that this was a Fremen quality. 
17.0,163,text_content,on Arrakis.’ 
17.0,164,text_content,"‘Very important,’ he agreed. ‘What is this dish? It’s delicious.’ "
17.0,165,text_content,"‘Tongues of wild rabbit in a special sauce,’ she said. ‘A very old recipe.’ "
17.0,166,text_content,"‘I must have that recipe,’ the man said. "
17.0,167,text_content,She nodded. ‘I’ll see that you get it.’ 
17.0,168,text_content,"you see, with the Law of the Minimum.’ "
17.0,169,text_content,"And, naturally, the least favorable condition controls the growth rate.’ "
17.0,170,text_content,"‘It’s rare to find members of a Great House aware of planetological problems,’ Kynes said. ‘Water is the least favorable condition for life on Arrakis. And remember that ‘growth’ itself can produce unfavorable conditions unless treated with extreme care.’ "
17.0,171,text_content,have an orderly cycle of water to sustain human life under more favorable conditions?’ 
17.0,172,text_content,‘Impossible!’ The water magnate barked. 
17.0,173,text_content,Jessica turned her attention to Bewt. ‘Impossible?’ 
17.0,174,text_content,"‘Impossible on Arrakis,’ he said. ‘Don’t listen to this dreamer. All the laboratory evidence is against him.’ "
17.0,175,text_content,on this new interchange. 
17.0,176,text_content,that originated and exist out-of-doors where plants and animals carry on their normal existence.’ 
17.0,177,text_content,‘Normal!’ Bewt snorted. ‘Nothing about Arrakis is normal!’

17.0,179,text_content,"‘It’ll never be done,’ Bewt said. "
17.0,180,text_content,spoken of holding the conservatory plants in trust for Arrakis. 
17.0,181,text_content,"‘What would it take to set up the self-sustaining system, Doctor Kynes?’ Leto asked. "
17.0,182,text_content,"started the cyclic system,’ Kynes said. "
17.0,183,text_content,"‘Water’s the only problem?’ the Duke asked. He sensed Kynes’ excitement, felt himself caught up in it. "
17.0,184,text_content,plant life and large sources of free carbon dioxide from such phenomena as volcanoes. There are unusual chemical interchanges over large surface areas here.’ 
17.0,185,text_content,‘Do you have pilot projects?’ the Duke asked. 
17.0,186,text_content,"science may now draw its working facts,’ Kynes said. "
17.0,187,text_content,"‘There isn’t enough water,’ Bewt said. ‘There just isn’t enough water.’ "
17.0,188,text_content,"‘Master Bewt is an expert on water,’ Kynes said. He smiled, turned back to his dinner. "
17.0,189,text_content,"The Duke gestured sharply down with his right hand, barked: ‘No, I want an answer! Is there enough water, Doctor Kynes?’ "
17.0,190,text_content,Kynes stared at his plate. 
17.0,191,text_content,"Jessica watched the play of emotion on his face. ‘He masks himself well,’ she thought, but she had him registered now and read that he regretted his words. "
17.0,192,text_content,‘Is there enough water?’ the Duke demanded. 
17.0,193,text_content,"‘There … may be,’ Kynes said. "
17.0,194,text_content,‘He’s faking uncertainty!’Jessica thought. 
17.0,195,text_content,‘There is enough water! But Kynes doesn’t wish it to be known.’ 
17.0,196,text_content,"‘Our planetologist has many interesting dreams,’ Bewt said. ‘He dreams with the Fremen – of prophecies and messiahs.’ "
17.0,197,text_content,"Duncan Idaho, the woman with the mysterious escort service. "
17.0,198,text_content,"‘Tensions are oddly distributed here tonight,’ Jessica thought. ‘There’s too much going on of which I’m not aware. I’ll have to develop new information sources.’ "
17.0,199,text_content,"‘‘May’ be,’ he muttered. "
17.0,200,text_content,"Kynes spoke quickly: ‘Perhaps we should discuss this another time, my Lord. There are so many—’ "
17.0,201,text_content,"The planetologist broke off as a uniformed Atreides trooper hurried in through the service door, was passed by the guard and rushed to the Duke’s side. The man bent, whispering into Leto’s ear. "
17.0,202,text_content,"feminine companion – a tiny, dark-haired woman with a doll face, a touch of epicanthic fold to the eyes. "
17.0,203,text_content,"‘You’ve hardly touched your dinner, my dear,’ Jessica said. ‘May I order you something?’ "
17.0,204,text_content,"The woman looked at the stillsuit manufacturer before answering, then: ‘I’m not very hungry.’ "
17.0,205,text_content,if you please.’ 
17.0,206,text_content,"to his father’s chair, sat down at it. "

17.0,208,text_content,"his baliset against the wall, crossed to the chair Paul had occupied, sat down. "
17.0,209,text_content,"be perfectly secure as long as you remain here, and we’ll have this little trouble cleared up very shortly.’ "
17.0,210,text_content,"Paul caught the code words in his father’s message – ‘guard-safe-secure-shortly.’ The problem was security, not violence. He saw that his mother had read the same message. They both relaxed. "
17.0,211,text_content,"The Duke gave a short nod, wheeled and strode through the service door followed by his trooper. "
17.0,212,text_content,Paul said: ‘Please go on with your dinner. I believe Doctor Kynes was discussing water.’ 
17.0,213,text_content,‘May we discuss it another time?’ Kynes asked. 
17.0,214,text_content,"‘By all means,’ Paul said. "
17.0,215,text_content,"And Jessica noted with pride her son’s dignity, the mature sense of assurance. "
17.0,216,text_content,dollop of wisdom for the boy who must be treated like a man.’ 
17.0,217,text_content,troopers along the walls move into positions of maximum guard. 
17.0,218,text_content,Bewt cast a venomous glare at the banker. 
17.0,219,text_content,"flagon. He said: ‘Once, on Caladan, I saw the body of a drowned fisherman recovered. He—’ "
17.0,220,text_content,‘Drowned?’ It was the stillsuit manufacturer’s daughter. 
17.0,221,text_content,"Paul hesitated, then: ‘Yes. Immersed in water until dead. Drowned.’ "
17.0,222,text_content,"‘What an interesting way to die,’ she murmured. "
17.0,223,text_content,attempt to reach up to the surface – to reach air.’ 
17.0,224,text_content,‘Why is this interesting?’ the banker asked. 
17.0,225,text_content,"see the point coming, then: ‘And, I should add, except when you see it at the dinner table.’ "
17.0,226,text_content,A sudden stillness enfolded the room. 
17.0,227,text_content,him. 
17.0,228,text_content,"‘Ho-ho-ho-o-o-o!’ It was the smuggler, Tuek, head thrown back, laughing with complete abandon. "
17.0,229,text_content,Nervous smiles appeared around the table. 
17.0,230,text_content,Bewt was grinning. 
17.0,231,text_content,"The banker had pushed his chair back, was glaring at Paul. "
17.0,232,text_content,Kynes said: ‘One baits an Atreides at his own risk.’ 
17.0,233,text_content,‘Is it Atreides custom to insult their guests?’ the banker demanded. 
17.0,234,text_content,"Before Paul could answer, Jessica leaned forward, said: ‘Sir!’ And she thought: ‘We must learn this Harkonnen creature’s game. Is he here to try for Paul? Does he have help?’ "
17.0,235,text_content,slid a hand down her leg to the crysknife she had fastened in a calf-sheath. 
17.0,236,text_content,himself for action. He had focused on the code word: ‘garment. ‘Prepare for violence.’’ 
17.0,237,text_content,"Kynes directed a speculative look at Jessica, gave a subtle hand signal to Tuek. "
17.0,238,text_content,"by his looks, but a man by his actions.’ "
17.0,239,text_content,‘Why do they intrude?’Jessica asked herself. 
17.0,240,text_content,"The banker stared now at Kynes, and Jessica saw terror return to the agent’s face. "
17.0,241,text_content,People began responding all around the table. 
17.0,242,text_content,And certainly not because he’s a civil servant.’ 
17.0,243,text_content,"She removed her hand from the crysknife hilt, lifted her flagon to Kynes, who responded in kind. "
17.0,244,text_content,Only Paul and the banker – ‘(Soo-Soo! What an idiotic nickname!’ Jessica thought.) – remained empty-handed. The banker’s attention stayed fixed on Kynes. Paul stared at his plate. 
17.0,245,text_content,"‘I was handling it correctly,’ Paul thought. ‘Why do they interfere?’ He glanced covertly at the male guests nearest him. ‘Prepare for violence? From whom? Certainly not from that banker fellow.’ "
17.0,246,text_content,"daughter beside him. ‘Don’t you think so, miss?’ "
17.0,247,text_content,but people die anyway. It doesn’t make sense.’ 
17.0,248,text_content,"‘Indeed it doesn’t,’ Halleck said. "
17.0,249,text_content,sex. Jessica relaxed. Her son had probably been first to see it – his training hadn’t overlooked the obvious gambit. 
17.0,250,text_content,Kynes spoke to the banker: ‘Isn’t another apology in order?’ 
17.0,251,text_content,"at table, and I’m not accustomed to it.’ "
17.0,252,text_content,of custom and training.’ 
17.0,253,text_content,"‘Thank you, my Lady,’ he said. "
17.0,254,text_content,I do hope that doesn’t mean more fighting.’ 
17.0,255,text_content,"‘She was directed to lead the conversation this way,’ Jessica thought. "
17.0,256,text_content,"‘Is this not so, Dr Kynes?’ "
17.0,257,text_content,"‘Indeed it is,’ Kynes said. "
17.0,258,text_content,some of that bird dish you served earlier.’ 
17.0,259,text_content,"so many interesting things about Arrakis. Tell me, where is the spice found? Do the hunters go deep into the desert?’ "
17.0,260,text_content,"‘Oh, no, my Lady,’ he said. ‘Very little’s known of the deep desert. And almost nothing of the southern regions.’ "
17.0,261,text_content,if we had a weather satellite …’ 
17.0,262,text_content,out soaks and sip-wells even in the southern latitudes.’ 
17.0,263,text_content,‘Soaks and sip-wells?’Jessica asked. 
17.0,264,text_content,of soak where a person draws water through a straw … so it is said.’ 
17.0,265,text_content,"‘There’s deception in his’ words, Jessica thought. "
17.0,266,text_content,‘Why is he lying?’ Paul wondered. 
17.0,267,text_content,"‘How very interesting,’ Jessica said. And she thought: ‘‘It is said’ …’ ‘What a curious speech mannerism they have here. If they only knew what it reveals about their dependence on superstitions.’ "
17.0,268,text_content,"‘I’ve heard you have a saying,’ Paul said, ‘that polish comes from the cities; wisdom from the desert.’ "
17.0,269,text_content,"‘There are many sayings on Arrakis,’ Kynes said. "
17.0,270,text_content,"and code signs, scanned it. "
17.0,271,text_content,"a smugglers’ base, hoping to sell it there. Both man and machine were turned over to our forces.’ She nodded to Tuek. "
17.0,272,text_content,The smuggler nodded back. 
17.0,273,text_content,"Jessica refolded the note, tucked it into her sleeve. "
17.0,274,text_content,"‘I’m glad it didn’t come to open battle,’ the banker said. ‘The people have such hopes the Atreides will bring peace and prosperity.’ "
17.0,275,text_content,"‘Especially prosperity,’ Bewt said. "
17.0,276,text_content,‘Shall we have our dessert now?’Jessica asked. ‘I’ve had our chef prepare a Caladan sweet: pongi rice in sauce dolsa.’ 
17.0,277,text_content,"‘It sounds wonderful,’ the stillsuit manufacturer said. ‘Would it be possible to get the recipe?’ "
17.0,278,text_content,"‘Any recipe you desire,’ Jessica said, ‘registering’ the man for later mention to Hawat. The stillsuit manufacturer was a fearful little climber and could be bought. "
17.0,279,text_content,a production increase next quarter …’

18.0,4,text_content,The disturbance was loud and incoherent. 
18.0,5,text_content,‘Is this the Harkonnen attack?’ she wondered. 
18.0,6,text_content,"no one in the Duke’s room, his bed was unrumpled. Was he still at the field C.P.? "
18.0,7,text_content,There were no screens yet to the front of the house. 
18.0,8,text_content,"Jessica stood in the middle of her room, listening. "
18.0,9,text_content,"pushed her feet into slippers, strapped the crysknife to her leg. "
18.0,10,text_content,"Again, a voice called out for Yueh. "
18.0,11,text_content,"Jessica belted the robe around her, stepped into the hallway. Then the thought struck her: ‘What if Leto’s hurt?’ "
18.0,12,text_content,"hall and down the passage to the Great Hall, finding the place brightly lighted, all the wall suspensors glowing at maximum. "
18.0,13,text_content,"there was an abrupt, panting silence to the scene. "
18.0,14,text_content,One of the house guards spoke accusingly to Idaho: ‘You see what you did? You woke the Lady Jessica.’ 
18.0,15,text_content,pushed into unlaced desert boots. 
18.0,16,text_content,on Grumman!’ 
18.0,17,text_content,‘Great Mother! He’s drunk!Jessica’ thought. 
18.0,18,text_content,A jagged rent in his tunic exposed an expanse of the dress shirt he had worn at the dinner party earlier. 
18.0,19,text_content,Jessica crossed to him. 
18.0,20,text_content,do at all. Give us a bad name here.’ 
18.0,21,text_content,‘Where has he been?’Jessica asked. 
18.0,22,text_content,"‘He escorted one of the young ladies home from the dinner, my Lady. Hawat’s orders.’ "
18.0,23,text_content,‘Which young lady?’ 
18.0,24,text_content,for special surveillance of the ladies.’ 
18.0,25,text_content,And Jessica thought: ‘So they are. But why is he drunk?’ 
18.0,26,text_content,"She frowned, turned to Mapes. ‘Mapes, bring a stimulant. I’d suggest caffeine. Perhaps there’s some of the spice coffee left.’ "
18.0,27,text_content,"Mapes shrugged, headed for the kitchen. Her unlaced desert boots slap-slapped against the stone floor. "

18.0,30,text_content,"fool uh m’self, huh?’ "
18.0,31,text_content,"Jessica frowned, remained silent, wondering: ‘Why would Idaho get drunk? Was he drugged?’ "

18.0,36,text_content,"Yueh turned, looked at the cup in Mapes’ hand. ‘What is that?’ "
18.0,37,text_content,"‘Caffeine,’Jessica said. "
18.0,38,text_content,"Yueh took the cup, held it toward Idaho. ‘Drink this, lad.’ "
18.0,39,text_content,‘Don’ wan’ any more t’ drink.’ 
18.0,40,text_content,"‘Drink it, I say!’ "
18.0,41,text_content,"pleasin’ th’ ‘Mperial Universe, Doc. Jus’ once, we’re gonna do th’ thing my way.’ "

18.0,44,text_content,"‘Well, it’s nighttime now,’ Yueh said. He spoke reasonably. ‘Drink this like a good lad. It’ll make you feel better.’ "
18.0,45,text_content,‘Don’ wanna feel bedder!’ 
18.0,46,text_content,"‘We can’t argue with him all night,’ Jessica said. And she thought: ‘This calls for shock treatment.’ "
18.0,47,text_content,"‘There’s no reason for you to stay, my Lady,’ Yueh said. ‘I can take care of this.’ "
18.0,48,text_content,"Jessica shook her head. She stepped forward, slapped Idaho sharply across the cheek. "
18.0,49,text_content,"He stumbled back with his guards, glaring at her. "
18.0,50,text_content,the cup toward Idaho. ‘Now drink this! That’s an order!’ 
18.0,51,text_content,orders from a damn’ Harkonnen spy.’ 
18.0,52,text_content,"Yueh stiffened, whirled to face Jessica. "
18.0,53,text_content,she could feel the blaze flickering. 
18.0,54,text_content,‘They were always calling on Idaho for surveillance of the ladies!’ 
18.0,55,text_content,She shot a glance at Yueh. The doctor lowered his eyes. 
18.0,56,text_content,‘You knew this?’ she demanded. 
18.0,57,text_content,"‘I … heard rumors, my Lady. But I didn’t want to add to your burdens.’ "
18.0,58,text_content,‘Hawat!’ she snapped. ‘I want Thufir Hawat brought to me immediately!’ 
18.0,59,text_content,"‘But, my Lady …’ "
18.0,60,text_content,‘Immediately!’ 
18.0,61,text_content,"‘It has to be Hawat,’ she thought. ‘Suspicion such as this could come from no other source without being discarded immediately.’ "

18.0,64,text_content,"The two guards stared at her unhappily. One ventured: ‘Perhaps we should take him someplace else, m’Lady. We could …’ "
18.0,65,text_content,the ladies.’ 
18.0,66,text_content,The guard swallowed. 
18.0,67,text_content,‘Do you know where the Duke is?’ she demanded. 
18.0,68,text_content,"‘He’s at the command post, my Lady.’ "
18.0,69,text_content,‘Is Hawat with him?’ 
18.0,70,text_content,"‘Hawat’s in the city, my Lady.’ "
18.0,71,text_content,"‘You will bring Hawat to me at once,’Jessica said. ‘I will be in my sitting room when he arrives.’ "
18.0,72,text_content,"‘But, my Lady …’ "
18.0,73,text_content,"‘If necessary, I will call the Duke,’ she said. ‘I hope it will not be necessary. I would not want to disturb him with this.’ "
18.0,74,text_content,"‘Yes, my Lady.’ "
18.0,75,text_content,"bed, Mapes.’ "
18.0,76,text_content,You’re sure you’ll not need me?’ 
18.0,77,text_content,Jessica smiled grimly. ‘I’m sure.’ 
18.0,78,text_content,"‘Perhaps this could wait until tomorrow,’ Yueh said. ‘I could give you a sedative and …’ "
18.0,79,text_content,her command. ‘This is the only way.’ 
18.0,80,text_content,of her sitting room. ‘Hawat! Could he be the one the Harkonnens bought? We shall see.’ 
18.0,81,text_content,zither beside the door to her bedroom. 
18.0,82,text_content,the chair’s regal heaviness for this occasion. 
18.0,83,text_content,"‘Now, let him come,’ she thought. ‘We shall see what we shall see.’ And she prepared herself in the Bene Gesserit fashion for the wait, accumulating patience, saving her strength. "
18.0,84,text_content,"Sooner than she had expected, a rap sounded at the door and Hawat entered at her command. "
18.0,85,text_content,"there was a wide, wet stain on the sleeve of his knife arm. "
18.0,86,text_content,She smelled blood there. 
18.0,87,text_content,"Jessica gestured to one of the straight-backed chairs, said: ‘Bring that chair and sit facing me.’ "
18.0,88,text_content,"Hawat bowed, obeyed. ‘That drunken fool of an Idaho!’ he thought. He studied Jessica’s face, wondering how he could save this situation. "
18.0,89,text_content,"‘It’s long past time to clear the air between us,’Jessica said. "
18.0,90,text_content,"‘What troubles my Lady?’ He sat down, placed hands on knees. "
18.0,91,text_content,did. Shall we be at least that honest with each other?’ 
18.0,92,text_content,"‘As you wish, my Lady.’ "
18.0,93,text_content,"‘First, you will answer me one question,’ she said. Are you now a Harkonnen agent?’ "
18.0,94,text_content,"Hawat surged half out of his chair, his face dark with fury, demanding: ‘You dare insult me so?’ "
18.0,95,text_content,"‘Sit down,’ she said. ‘You insulted me so.’ "
18.0,96,text_content,"Slowly, he sank back into the chair. "
18.0,97,text_content,"And Jessica, reading the signs on this face that she knew so well, allowed herself a deep breath. ‘It isn’t Hawat.’ "
18.0,98,text_content,"‘Now I know you remain loyal to my Duke,’ she said. ‘I’m prepared, therefore, to forgive your affront to me.’ "
18.0,99,text_content,‘Is there something to forgive?’ 
18.0,100,text_content,to use this.’ 
18.0,101,text_content,"‘A Truthsayer would solve this,’ she said, ‘but we have no Truthsayer qualified by the High Board.’ "
18.0,102,text_content,‘As you say. We’ve no Truthsayer.’ 
18.0,103,text_content,"not Duncan. ‘Their’ lieutenants are not strategically enough placed to consider. It’s not you, Thufir. It cannot be Paul. I ‘know’ it’s not me. Dr Yueh, then? Shall I call him in and put him to the test?’ "
18.0,104,text_content,"‘You know that’s an empty gesture,’ Hawat said. ‘He’s conditioned by the High College. ‘That’ I know for certain.’ "
18.0,105,text_content,"‘Not to mention that his wife was a Bene Gesserit slain by the Harkonnens,’Jessica said. "
18.0,106,text_content,"‘So that’s what happened to her,’ Hawat said. "
18.0,107,text_content,‘Haven’t you heard the hate in his voice when he speaks the Harkonnen name?’ 
18.0,108,text_content,"‘You know I don’t have the ear,’ Hawat said. "
18.0,109,text_content,‘What brought this base suspicion on me?’ she asked. 
18.0,110,text_content,Hawat frowned. ‘My Lady puts her servant in an impossible position. My first loyalty is to the Duke.’ 
18.0,111,text_content,"‘I’m prepared to forgive much because of that loyalty,’ she said. "
18.0,112,text_content,‘And again I must ask: Is there something to forgive?’ 
18.0,113,text_content,‘Stalemate?’ she asked. 
18.0,114,text_content,He shrugged. 
18.0,115,text_content,among our people have been stupefied by this concoction. Is that true?’ 
18.0,116,text_content,"‘You have your reports, my Lady.’ "
18.0,117,text_content,"‘So I do. Don’t you see this drinking as a symptom, Thufir?’ "
18.0,118,text_content,‘My Lady speaks riddles.’ 
18.0,119,text_content,– they have no home.’ 
18.0,120,text_content,"He jabbed a finger at the floor. ‘Arrakis, that’s their home.’ "
18.0,121,text_content,them.’ 
18.0,122,text_content,He stiffened. ‘Such talk from one of the men would be cause for—’ 
18.0,123,text_content,to cure the disease.’ 
18.0,124,text_content,‘The Duke gives me charge over such matters.’ 
18.0,125,text_content,I have certain abilities along these lines.’ 
18.0,126,text_content,‘Will I have to shock him severely?’ she wondered. ‘He needs shaking up – something to break him from routine.’ 
18.0,127,text_content,"‘There could be many interpretations for your concern,’ Hawat said. He shrugged. "
18.0,128,text_content,‘Then you’ve already convicted me?’ 
18.0,129,text_content,"‘Of course not, my Lady. But I cannot afford to take ‘any’ chances, the situation being what it is.’ "
18.0,130,text_content,"‘A threat to my son got past you right here in this house,’ she said. ‘Who took that chance?’ "
18.0,131,text_content,His face darkened. ‘I offered my resignation to the Duke.’ 
18.0,132,text_content,‘Did you offer your resignation to me … or to Paul?’ 
18.0,133,text_content,beating at his temple. 
18.0,134,text_content,"‘I’m the Duke’s man,’ he said, biting off the words. "
18.0,135,text_content,secreting a few lasguns with timing mechanisms aimed at house shields. Perhaps they’ll …’ 
18.0,136,text_content,"‘And who could tell after the blast if the explosion wasn’t atomic?’ he asked. ‘No, my Lady. They’ll not risk anything ‘that’ illegal. Radiation lingers. The evidence is hard to erase. No. They’ll observe ‘most’ of the forms. It has to be a traitor.’ "
18.0,137,text_content,"‘You’re the Duke’s man,’ she sneered. ‘Would you destroy him in the effort to save him?’ "
18.0,138,text_content,"He took a deep breath, then: ‘If you’re innocent, you’ll have my most abject apologies.’ "
18.0,139,text_content,"be most susceptible to such whispering, Thufir? Must I draw it for you more clearly?’ "
18.0,140,text_content,‘You threaten me?’ he growled. 
18.0,141,text_content,diabolical. I propose to negate this attack by so ordering our lives that there’ll be no chinks for such barbs to enter.’ 
18.0,142,text_content,‘You accuse me of whispering baseless suspicions?’ 
18.0,143,text_content,"‘Baseless, yes.’ "
18.0,144,text_content,‘You’d meet this with your own whispers?’ 
18.0,145,text_content,"‘‘Your’ life is compounded of whispers, not mine, Thufir.’ "
18.0,146,text_content,‘Then you question my abilities?’ 
18.0,147,text_content,all sides.’ 
18.0,148,text_content,"‘You think now to teach me my trade?’ he asked, and he did not try to hide the disdain in his voice. "
18.0,149,text_content,deep-seated thing that’s really chewing on us.’ 
18.0,150,text_content,"people attempting thus to sabotage any other weapon in our arsenal, I should not hesitate to denounce and destroy him.’ "
18.0,151,text_content,"‘The finest Mentats have a healthy respect for the error factor in their computations,’ she said. "

18.0,154,text_content,"‘Idleness, no more,’ he said. ‘Don’t try to divert my attention by trying to make a simple matter appear mysterious.’ "

18.0,156,text_content,‘Why have you never made full use of my abilities in your service to the Duke?’ she asked. ‘Do you fear a rival ‘for your’ position?’ 
18.0,157,text_content,"He glared at her, the old eyes blazing. ‘I know some of the training they give you Bene Gesserit …’ He broke off, scowling. "
18.0,158,text_content,"‘Go ahead, say it,’ she said. ‘Bene Gesserit ‘witches,’’ "
18.0,159,text_content,exist only to serve.’ 
18.0,160,text_content,"‘The shock must be severe and he’s almost ready for it,’ she thought. "
18.0,161,text_content,"‘You listen respectfully to me in Council,’ she said, ‘yet you seldom heed my advice. Why?’ "
18.0,162,text_content,"‘I don’t trust your Bene Gesserit motives,’ he said. You may think you can look through a man; you may ‘think’ you can make a man do exactly what you—’ "
18.0,163,text_content,"‘You poor ‘fool,’ Thufir!’ she raged. "
18.0,164,text_content,"He scowled, pushing himself back in the chair. "
18.0,165,text_content,"you, or any other person within my reach, you could not stop me.’ "
18.0,166,text_content,And she thought: ‘Why do I let pride drive such words out of me? This is not the way I was trained. This is not how I must shock him.’ 
18.0,167,text_content,"Hawat slipped a hand beneath his tunic where he kept a tiny projector of poison darts. ‘She wears no shield,’ he thought. ‘Is this just a brag she makes? I could slay her now … but, ah-h-h-h, the consequences if I’m wrong.’ "
18.0,168,text_content,"Jessica saw the gesture toward his pocket, said: ‘Let us pray violence shall never be necessary between us.’ "
18.0,169,text_content,"‘A worthy prayer,’ he agreed. "
18.0,170,text_content,have planted this suspicion to pit the two of us against each other?’ 
18.0,171,text_content,"‘We appear to’ve returned to stalemate,’ he said. "
18.0,172,text_content,"She sighed, thinking: ‘He’s almost ready for it.’ "
18.0,173,text_content,"‘The Duke and I are father and mother surrogates to our people,’ she said. ‘The position—’ "
18.0,174,text_content,"‘He hasn’t married you,’ Hawat said. "
18.0,175,text_content,"She forced herself to calmness, thinking: ‘A good riposte, that.’ "
18.0,176,text_content,"natural order in our affairs, to disturb, disrupt, and confuse us – which target offers itself most enticingly to the Harkonnens?’ "
18.0,177,text_content,"He sensed the direction she was taking, and his brows drew down in a lowering scowl. "
18.0,178,text_content,him. ‘You!’ 
18.0,179,text_content,Hawat started to leap from his chair. 
18.0,180,text_content,"‘I have not dismissed you, Thufir!’ she flared. "
18.0,181,text_content,"The old Mentat almost fell back into the chair, so quickly did his muscles betray him. "
18.0,182,text_content,She smiled without mirth. 
18.0,183,text_content,"‘Now you know something of the ‘real’ training they give us,’ she said. "
18.0,184,text_content,"thus commanded, a depth of control he had not dreamed possible. "
18.0,185,text_content,"‘I have said to you before that we should understand each other,’ she said. ‘I meant ‘you’ should understand ‘me.’ I already understand you. And I tell you now that your loyalty to the Duke is all that guarantees your safety with me.’ "
18.0,186,text_content,"He stared at her, wet his lips with his tongue. "
18.0,187,text_content,"‘If I desired a puppet, the Duke would marry me,’ she said. ‘He might even think he did it of his own free will.’ "
18.0,188,text_content,"him. In the moment of hesitation, she could have drawn a weapon and killed him! "
18.0,189,text_content,‘Does every human have this blind spot?’ he wondered. ‘Can any of us be ordered into action before he can resist?’ The idea staggered him. ‘Who could stop a person with such power?’ 
18.0,190,text_content,simple thing for us. You’ve not seen my entire arsenal. Think on that.’ 
18.0,191,text_content,‘Why aren’t you out destroying the Duke’s enemies?’ he asked. 
18.0,192,text_content,"‘What would you have me destroy?’ she asked. Would you have me make a weakling of our Duke, have him forever leaning on me?’ "
18.0,193,text_content,"‘But, with such power …’ "
18.0,194,text_content,exist only to serve.’ 
18.0,195,text_content,"‘I cannot answer you,’ he said. You know I cannot answer.’ "
18.0,196,text_content,"You’ll say nothing about what has happened here to anyone,’ she said. ‘I know you, Thufir.’ "
18.0,197,text_content,‘My Lady …’ Again the old man tried to swallow in a dry throat. 
18.0,198,text_content,"And he thought: ‘She has great powers, yes. But would these not make her an even more formidable tool for the Harkonnens?’ "
18.0,199,text_content,of this suspicion and remove it.’ 
18.0,200,text_content,"‘If it proves baseless,’ he said. "
18.0,201,text_content,‘‘If’’ she sneered. 
18.0,202,text_content,"‘If,’ he said. "
18.0,203,text_content,"‘You ‘are’ tenacious,’ she said. "

19.0,5,text_content,"It was a dull sound, directionless in the dark. Somewhere. "
19.0,6,text_content,"The waiting moment was packed with time, with rustling needle-stick movements. "
19.0,7,text_content,"behind her. She tested the bindings, realized they were krimskell fiber, would only claw tighter as she pulled. "
19.0,8,text_content,"And now, she remembered. "
19.0,9,text_content,sinking her into a black bin of terror. 
19.0,10,text_content,"‘It has come,’ she thought. ‘How simple it was to subdue the Bene Gesserit. All it took was treachery. Hawat was right.’ "
19.0,11,text_content,She forced herself not to pull on her bindings. 
19.0,12,text_content,"‘This is not my bedroom,’ she thought. ‘They’ve taken me someplace else.’ "
19.0,13,text_content,"Slowly, she marshaled the inner calmness. "
19.0,14,text_content,She grew aware of the smell of her own stale sweat with its chemical infusion of fear. 
19.0,15,text_content,‘Where is Paul?’ she asked herself. ‘My son – what have they done to him?’ 
19.0,16,text_content,‘Calmness.’ 
19.0,17,text_content,"She forced herself to it, using the ancient routines. "
19.0,18,text_content,But terror remained so near. 
19.0,19,text_content,"‘Leto? Where are you, Leto?’ "
19.0,20,text_content,A line under a door. 
19.0,21,text_content,‘‘I’m on the floor.’ 
19.0,22,text_content,"People walking. She sensed it through the floor. Jessica squeezed back the memory of terror. ‘I must remain calm, alert, and prepared. I may get only one chance.’ Again, she forced the inner calmness. "
19.0,23,text_content,"The ungainly thumping of her heartbeats evened, shaping out time. She counted back. ‘I was unconscious about an hour.’ She closed her eyes, focused her awareness onto the approaching footsteps. "
19.0,24,text_content,‘Four people.’ 
19.0,25,text_content,She counted the differences in their steps. 
19.0,26,text_content,"‘I must pretend I’m still unconscious.’ She relaxed against the cold floor, testing her body’s readiness, heard a door open, sensed increased light through her eyelids. "
19.0,27,text_content,Feet approached: someone standing over her. 
19.0,28,text_content,"‘You are awake,’ rumbled a basso voice. ‘Do not pretend.’ "
19.0,29,text_content,She opened her eyes. 
19.0,30,text_content,in the hallway beyond that hurt her eyes. 
19.0,31,text_content,mounds beneath spider-black eyes. 
19.0,32,text_content,"‘The drug was timed,’ he rumbled. ‘We knew to the minute when you’d be coming out of it.’ "
19.0,33,text_content,"‘How could that be?’ she wondered. ‘They’d have to know my exact weight, my metabolism, my … Yueh!’ "
19.0,34,text_content,"‘Such a pity you must remain gagged,’ the Baron said. ‘We could have such an interesting conversation.’ "
19.0,35,text_content,"‘Yueh’s the only one it could be,’ she thought. ‘How?’ "
19.0,36,text_content,"The Baron glanced behind him at the door. ‘Come in, Piter.’ "
19.0,37,text_content,him suggested effeminacy. 
19.0,38,text_content,"He glanced at the Mentat. ‘Isn’t that true, Piter?’ "
19.0,39,text_content,"As you say, Baron,’ the man said. "
19.0,40,text_content,Bene Gesserit training the voice screamed: ‘Killer!’ 
19.0,41,text_content,I wish to demonstrate a thing: that he does not really want you.’ 
19.0,42,text_content,"‘You play with me, Baron?’ Piter asked, and he smiled. "
19.0,43,text_content,The Baron could not read that smile. He did not have the Training. 
19.0,44,text_content,really wants. Piter wants power.’ 
19.0,45,text_content,an inward shudder. ‘How could the Baron have made such an animal out of a Mentat?’ 
19.0,46,text_content,"‘I give you a choice, Piter,’ the Baron said. "
19.0,47,text_content,‘What choice?’ 
19.0,48,text_content,see fit in my name.’ Jessica watched the Baron’s spider eyes study Piter. 
19.0,49,text_content,"‘You could be Duke here in all but name,’ the Baron said. "
19.0,50,text_content,"‘Is my Leto dead, then?’ Jessica asked herself. She felt a silent wail begin somewhere in her mind. "
19.0,51,text_content,that’s the reality. With it you could have many women … and more.’ 
19.0,52,text_content,‘You do not joke with Piter?’ 
19.0,53,text_content,her gag until you’re off Arrakis. If you choose not to leave … he has other orders.’ 
19.0,54,text_content,"‘You don’t have to leave,’ Piter said. ‘I’ve chosen.’ "
19.0,55,text_content,"‘Ah, hah!’ the Baron chortled. ‘Such quick decision can mean only one thing.’ "
19.0,56,text_content,"‘I will take the duchy,’ Piter said. "
19.0,57,text_content,And Jessica thought: ‘Doesn’t Piter know the Baron’s lying to him? But – how could he know? He’s a twisted Mentat.’ 
19.0,58,text_content,"would be Piter’s choice. Hah! Well, I leave now. This is much better. Ah-h, much better. You understand, Lady Jessica? I hold no rancor toward you. It’s a necessity. Much better this way. Yes. And I’ve not ‘actually’ ordered you destroyed. When it’s asked of me what happened to you, I can shrug it off in all truth.’ "
19.0,59,text_content,‘You leave it to me then?’ Piter asked. 
19.0,60,text_content,"doing whatever you must do. Yes. Well … ah, yes. Yes. Good.’ "
19.0,61,text_content,"this for sure. Ah-h-h-h, my poor Leto.’ "
19.0,62,text_content,"With one last glance at Jessica, the Baron turned, went out the door. She followed him with her eyes, thinking: ‘It’s as the Reverend Mother warned – too potent an adversary.’ "
19.0,63,text_content,"Two Harkonnen troopers entered. Another, his face a scarred mask, followed and stood in the doorway with drawn lasgun. "
19.0,64,text_content,"‘The deaf one,’ Jessica thought, studying the scarred face. ‘The Baron knows I could use the Voice on any other man.’ "
19.0,65,text_content,Scarface looked at Piter. ‘We’ve the boy on a litter outside. What are your orders?’ 
19.0,66,text_content,will destroy all evidence. Their bodies must never be found.’ 
19.0,67,text_content,‘You don’t wish to dispatch them yourself?’ Scarface asked. 
19.0,68,text_content,"‘He reads lips,’ Jessica thought. "
19.0,69,text_content,"‘I follow my Baron’s example,’ Piter said. ‘Take them where the traitor said.’ "
19.0,70,text_content,"Jessica heard the harsh Mentat control in Piter’s voice, thought: ‘He, too, fears the Truthsayer.’ "
19.0,71,text_content,"look at her, but he went out without turning. "
19.0,72,text_content,"‘Me, I wouldn’t like the thought of facing that Truthsayer after this night’s work,’ Scarface said. "
19.0,73,text_content,over her. ‘It ain’t getting our work done standing around here chattering. Take her feet and—’ 
19.0,74,text_content,‘Why’n’t we kill ‘em here?’ Scarface asked. 
19.0,75,text_content,"desert like that traitor said, cut ‘em once or twice, leave the evidence for the worms. Nothing to clean up afterward.’ "
19.0,76,text_content,"‘Yeah … well, I guess you’re right,’ Scarface said. "
19.0,77,text_content,"Jessica listened to them, watching, registering. But the gag blocked her Voice, and there was the deaf one to consider. "
19.0,78,text_content,even. 
19.0,79,text_content,‘Is he drugged?’ she wondered. 
19.0,80,text_content,"The troopers lifted the litter, and Paul’s eyes opened the smallest fraction – dark slits staring at her. "
19.0,81,text_content,‘He mustn’t try the Voice!’ she prayed. ‘The deaf guard!’ 
19.0,82,text_content,Paul’s eyes closed. 
19.0,83,text_content,expand any opportunity. 
19.0,84,text_content,"Paul allowed himself another slit-eyed inspection of his mother’s face. She appeared unharmed. Gagged, though. "
19.0,85,text_content,"to find himself bound to this litter. Perhaps a similar thing had befallen her. Logic said the traitor was Yueh, but he held final decision in abeyance. There was no understanding it – a Suk doctor a traitor. "
19.0,86,text_content,The litter settled to the ground. 
19.0,87,text_content,at the green gloom illuminated by the instrument panel. 
19.0,88,text_content,"‘This the ’thopter we’re supposed to use?’ he asked, and turned to watch his companion’s lips. "
19.0,89,text_content,"‘It’s the one the traitor said was fixed for desert work,’ the other said. "
19.0,90,text_content,Scarface nodded. ‘But it’s one of them little liaison jobs. Ain’t room in there for more’n them an’ two of us.’ 
19.0,91,text_content,"here on, Kinet.’ "
19.0,92,text_content,"‘The Baron he told me to make sure what happened to them two,’ Scarface said. "
19.0,93,text_content,‘What you so worried about?’ asked another trooper from behind the litter-bearer. 
19.0,94,text_content,"‘She is a Bene Gesserit witch,’ the deaf one said. ‘They have powers.’ "
19.0,95,text_content,"‘Ah-h-h …’ The litter-bearer made the sign of the fist at his ear. ‘One of them, eh? Know whatcha mean.’ "
19.0,96,text_content,"one of them big worms. Eh, Czigo?’ He nudged the litter-bearer. "
19.0,97,text_content,you wants to make sure what happens.’ 
19.0,98,text_content,"‘It is nice of you to invite me, Czigo,’ Scarface said. "
19.0,99,text_content,"Jessica felt herself lifted, the wing shadow spinning – stars. She was pushed into the rear of the ’thopter, her ‘krimskell’ fiber bindings examined, and she was strapped down. Paul was jammed in beside her, strapped securely, and she noted his bonds were simple rope. "
19.0,100,text_content,and took the other front seat. 
19.0,101,text_content,"Czigo tapped his companion’s shoulder, said: ‘Whyn’t you turn around and keep an eye on them two?’ "
19.0,102,text_content,‘Sure you know the way to go?’ Kinet watched Czigo’s lips. 
19.0,103,text_content,‘I listened to the traitor same’s you.’ 
19.0,104,text_content,at a sudden jerk. 
19.0,105,text_content,"‘Has someone been at this ’thopter, preparing it for us?’ she wondered. ‘Who?’ Slowly, she twisted her bound feet clear of Paul’s. "
19.0,106,text_content,to look at the pilot. 
19.0,107,text_content,"‘Bene Gesserit ain’t all highborn,’ the pilot said. "
19.0,108,text_content,‘But they all look heighty.’ 
19.0,109,text_content,"‘He can see me plain enough,’ Jessica thought. She brought her bound legs up onto the seat, curled into a sinuous ball, staring at Scarface. "
19.0,110,text_content,"‘Real pretty, she is,’ Kinet said. He wet his lips with his tongue. ‘Sure do seem a shame.’ He looked at Czigo. "
19.0,111,text_content,‘You thinking what I think you’re thinking?’ the pilot asked. 
19.0,112,text_content,like this one again.’ 
19.0,113,text_content,You lay a hand on my mother …’ Paul grated. He glared at Scarface. 
19.0,114,text_content,"‘Hey!’ the pilot laughed. ‘Cub’s got a bark. Ain’t got no bite, though.’ "
19.0,115,text_content,"And Jessica thought: ‘Paul’s pitching his voice too high. It may work, though.’ "
19.0,116,text_content,They flew on in silence. 
19.0,117,text_content,"‘These poor fools,’ Jessica thought, studying her guards and reviewing the Baron’s words. ‘They’ll be killed as soon as they report success on their mission. The Baron wants no witnesses.’ "
19.0,118,text_content,"The ’thopter banked over the southern rim of the Shield Wall, and Jessica saw a moonshadowed expanse of sand beneath them. "
19.0,119,text_content,"the craft toward the dunes in a long, falling stoop, brought it up stiffly over the desert surface. "
19.0,120,text_content,"helpless to aid him. ‘He hasn’t mastered the Voice yet,’ she thought, ‘if he fails …’ "
19.0,121,text_content,settle out of sight up there. 
19.0,122,text_content,"‘Someone’s following us!’ she thought. ‘Who! Then: The ones the Baron set to watch this pair. And there’ll be watchers for the watchers, too.’ "
19.0,123,text_content,Czigo shut off his wing rotors. Silence flooded in upon them. 
19.0,124,text_content,of rock rising from the desert. Sandblast ridges streaked its sides. 
19.0,125,text_content,Paul cleared his throat. 
19.0,126,text_content,"The pilot said: ‘Now, Kinet?’ "
19.0,127,text_content,"‘I dunno, Czigo.’ "
19.0,128,text_content,"Czigo turned, said: ‘Ah-h-h, look.’ He reached out for Jessica’s skirt. "
19.0,129,text_content,"‘Remove her gag,’ Paul commanded. "
19.0,130,text_content,"would have been better, but it could still fall within this man’s spectrum. "
19.0,131,text_content,"Czigo shifted his hand up to the band around Jessica’s mouth, slipped the knot on the gag. "
19.0,132,text_content,‘Stop that!’ Kinet ordered. 
19.0,133,text_content,studied Jessica. 
19.0,134,text_content,"Kinet put a hand on the pilot’s arm. ‘Look, Czigo, no need to …’ "
19.0,135,text_content,"Jessica twisted her neck, spat out the gag. She pitched her voice in low, intimate tones. ‘Gentlemen! No need ‘to fight’ over me.’ At the same time, she writhed sinuously for Kinet’s benefit. "
19.0,136,text_content,"required no other reason. In their minds, they ‘were’ fighting over her. "
19.0,137,text_content,"farther apart, glanced warily at each other. ‘Is any woman worth fighting over?’ she asked. "
19.0,138,text_content,"By uttering the words, by being there, she made herself infinitely worth their fighting. "
19.0,139,text_content,Voice. Now – everything depended on his mother whose experience went so far beyond his own. 
19.0,140,text_content,"‘Yeah,’ Scarface said. ‘No need to fight over …’ "
19.0,141,text_content,slammed into Kinet’s chest. 
19.0,142,text_content,"Scarface groaned, sagged backward against the door. "
19.0,143,text_content,in reflected moonlight. 
19.0,144,text_content,"‘Now for the cub,’ he said and leaned toward Paul. "
19.0,145,text_content,"‘No need for that,’Jessica murmured. "
19.0,146,text_content,Czigo hesitated. 
19.0,147,text_content,chance he’d have out there in that sand. Give him that and …’ She smiled. ‘You could find yourself well rewarded.’ 
19.0,148,text_content,said. ‘Boy might find the knife a kindness.’ 
19.0,149,text_content,‘Is it so much I ask?’Jessica pleaded. 
19.0,150,text_content,"‘You’re trying to trick me,’ Czigo muttered. "
19.0,151,text_content,"‘I don’t want to see my son die,’Jessica said. ‘Is that a trick?’ "
19.0,152,text_content,"the knife poised. ‘What’ll y’ do, cub, if I cut y’r bonds?’ "
19.0,153,text_content,"‘He’ll leave here immediately and head for those rocks,’ Jessica said. "
19.0,154,text_content,"‘Is that what y’ll do, cub?’ Czigo asked. "
19.0,155,text_content,Paul’s voice was properly surly. ‘Yes.’

19.0,160,text_content,"‘I saw the opening and used it,’ he said. "
19.0,161,text_content,"She heard the harsh control in his voice, said: Yueh’s house sign is scrawled on the ceiling of this cabin.’ "
19.0,162,text_content,"He looked up, saw the curling symbol. "
19.0,163,text_content,"‘Get out and let us study the craft,’ she said. ‘There’s a bundle under the pilot’s seat. I felt it when we got in.’ "

20.0,10,text_content,‘Merely unconscious. I suggest you tie him.’ 
20.0,11,text_content,‘Did you do for these others?’ He glanced back down the hall where Mapes’ body lay. 
20.0,12,text_content,"‘More’s the pity,’ Yueh muttered. "
20.0,13,text_content,"‘Pity!’ the Sardaukar sneered. He advanced, looked down at Leto. ‘So that’s the great Red Duke.’ "

20.0,17,text_content,‘I can see that!’ the Sardaukar snapped. 
20.0,18,text_content,"Yueh stiffened, swallowed. ‘If they press me, bring in a Truthsayer, they’ll find out about the ring, about the ’thopter I prepared – all will fail.’ "
20.0,19,text_content,"‘Sometimes the Duke sent the ring with a messenger as surety that an order came directly from him,’ Yueh said. "
20.0,20,text_content,"‘Must be damned trusted messengers,’ the Sardaukar muttered. "

20.0,22,text_content,‘How long’ll he be unconscious?’ 
20.0,23,text_content,‘Two hours or so. I wasn’t as precise with his dosage as I was for the woman and boy.’ 
20.0,24,text_content,The Sardaukar spurned the Duke with his toe. ‘This was nothing to fear even when awake. When will the woman and boy awaken?’ 
20.0,25,text_content,‘About ten minutes.’ 
20.0,26,text_content,‘So soon?’ 
20.0,27,text_content,‘I was told the Baron would arrive immediately behind his men.’ 
20.0,28,text_content,"‘So he will. You’ll wait outside, Yueh.’ He shot a hard glance at Yueh. ‘Now!’ "

20.0,37,text_content,"The Harkonnen guard released his arm, said: ‘Wait over there out of the way.’ "
20.0,38,text_content,"Abruptly, Yueh saw himself as cast away in this place of destruction, spared nothing, given not the smallest pity. ‘Idaho must not fail!’ "
20.0,39,text_content,"Another guard bumped into him, barked: ‘Stay out of the way, you!’ "
20.0,40,text_content,"‘Even when they’ve profited by me they despise me,’ Yueh thought. He straightened himself as he was pushed aside, regained some of his dignity. "

21.0,30,text_content,‘Do I?’ the Baron asked. 
21.0,31,text_content,‘You promised to deliver my Wanna from her agony.’ 
21.0,32,text_content,Piter. 
21.0,33,text_content,like a claw as it flashed into Yueh’s back. 
21.0,34,text_content,"The old man stiffened, never taking his attention from the Baron. "
21.0,35,text_content,‘So join her!’ the Baron spat. 
21.0,36,text_content,… de … feated … me. You … think … I … did … not … know … what … I … bought … for … my … Wanna.’ 
21.0,37,text_content,He toppled. No bending or softening. It was like a tree falling.

21.0,40,text_content,"‘So that’s how he kills by his own hand,’ the Baron thought. ‘It’s well to know.’ "
21.0,41,text_content,‘He ‘did’ give us the Duke?’ the Baron asked. 
21.0,42,text_content,"‘Of a certainty, my Lord,’ Piter said. "
21.0,43,text_content,‘Then get him in here!’ 
21.0,44,text_content,"Piter glanced at the guard captain, who whirled to obey. "
21.0,45,text_content,"The Baron looked down at Yueh. From the way the man had fallen, you could suspect oak in him instead of bones. "

21.0,47,text_content,the black. Porcelain white. 
21.0,48,text_content,But there was still the feeling of doubt. 
21.0,49,text_content,about thinking he’d been defeated: ‘‘You think you defeated me.’’ 
21.0,50,text_content,What had he meant? 
21.0,51,text_content,removed without first freeing the uniform ties. The Duke’s eyes held a glazed insane look. 
21.0,52,text_content,had lost some of its savor.

21.0,54,text_content,"drugged, my dear Duke?’ "
21.0,55,text_content,through the blanket. 
21.0,56,text_content,"‘What of the woman and the boy, Piter?’ the Baron asked. ‘Any word yet?’ "
21.0,57,text_content,Piter’s tongue darted over his lips. 
21.0,58,text_content,‘You’ve heard something!’ the Baron snapped. ‘What?’ 
21.0,59,text_content,… ah … found.’ 
21.0,60,text_content,"‘Well, they report everything satisfactory?’ "
21.0,61,text_content,"‘They’re dead, m’Lord.’ "
21.0,62,text_content,‘Of course they are! What I want to know is—’ 
21.0,63,text_content,"‘They were dead when found, m’Lord.’ "
21.0,64,text_content,The Baron’s face went livid. ‘And the woman and boy?’ 
21.0,65,text_content,Possibly—’ 
21.0,66,text_content,"‘We do not deal in possibilities, Piter. What of the missing ’thopter? Does that suggest anything to my Mentat?’ "
21.0,67,text_content,"‘One of the Duke’s men obviously escaped in it, m’Lord. Killed our pilot and escaped.’ "
21.0,68,text_content,‘Which of the Duke’s men?’ 
21.0,69,text_content,"‘It was a clean, silent killing, m’Lord. Hawat, perhaps, or that Halleck one. Possibly Idaho. Or any top lieutenant.’ "
21.0,70,text_content,"‘Possibilities,’ the Baron muttered. He glanced at the swaying, drugged figure of the Duke. "
21.0,71,text_content,"‘The situation is in hand, m’Lord,’ Piter said. "
21.0,72,text_content,"‘No, it isn’t! Where is that stupid planetologist? Where is this man Kynes?’ "
21.0,73,text_content,"‘We’ve word where to find him and he’s been sent for, m’Lord.’ "
21.0,74,text_content,"‘I don’t like the way the Emperor’s servant is helping us,’ the Baron muttered. "
21.0,75,text_content,"They were words through a cottony blanket, but some of them burned in Leto’s mind. ‘Woman and boy – no sign.’ Paul and Jessica had escaped. And the fate of Hawat, Halleck, and Idaho remained an unknown. There was still hope. "
21.0,76,text_content,‘Where is the ducal signet ring?’ the Baron demanded. ‘His finger is bare.’ 
21.0,77,text_content,"‘The Sardaukar say it was not on him when he was taken, my Lord,’ the guard captain said. "
21.0,78,text_content,for the good of our enterprise.’ He scowled. ‘Possibilities!’ 
21.0,79,text_content,The thought hung like a sine wave in Leto’s mind: ‘Paul and Jessica have escaped!’ And there was something else in his memory: a bargain. He could almost remember it. 
21.0,80,text_content,‘The tooth!’ 
21.0,81,text_content,He remembered part of it now: ‘a pill of poison gas shaped into a false tooth.’ 
21.0,82,text_content,to do was bite sharply on it. 
21.0,83,text_content,‘Not yet!’ 
21.0,84,text_content,The someone had told him to wait until he was near the Baron. Who had told him? He couldn’t remember. 
21.0,85,text_content,‘How long will he remain drugged like this?’ the Baron asked. 
21.0,86,text_content,"‘Perhaps another hour, m’Lord.’ "
21.0,87,text_content,"‘Perhaps,’ the Baron muttered. Again, he turned to the night-blackened window. ‘I am hungry.’ "
21.0,88,text_content,and darker. It folded into blackness and faded. 
21.0,89,text_content,Time became a sequence of layers for the Duke. He drifted up through them. ‘I must wait.’ 
21.0,90,text_content,"his tingling body in the chair. He was aware there had been a passage of time, but its length escaped him. "
21.0,91,text_content,"‘I believe he’s coming around, Baron.’ "
21.0,92,text_content,"‘A silky voice, that one. That was Piter.’ "
21.0,93,text_content,"‘So I see, Piter.’ "
21.0,94,text_content,‘A rumbling basso: the Baron.’ 
21.0,95,text_content,"Leto sensed increasing definition in his surroundings. The chair beneath him took on firmness, the bindings were sharper. "
21.0,96,text_content,"the handle of a spoon, a finger tracing the fold of a jowl. "
21.0,97,text_content,"Leto watched the moving hand, fascinated by it. "
21.0,98,text_content,and the child you sired on her.’ 
21.0,99,text_content,"No sign escaped Leto, but the words were a wash of calmness through him. ‘It’s true, then: they don’t have Paul and Jessica.’ "
21.0,100,text_content,straits – it set a bad precedent. 
21.0,101,text_content,mouth. 
21.0,102,text_content,‘Yueh.’ 
21.0,103,text_content,Drug-fogged memory of seeing a limp corpse dragged past him in this room hung like a vapor in Leto’s mind. He knew it had been Yueh. 
21.0,104,text_content,"‘Do you hear that noise, Duke Leto?’ the Baron asked. "
21.0,105,text_content,"Leto grew conscious of a frog sound, the burred mewling of someone’s agony. "
21.0,106,text_content,"not spy on those ragged scum of the desert. Tell me, did you buy their help? Did you send your woman and son to them?’ "
21.0,107,text_content,Leto felt fear tighten his chest. ‘If Yueh sent them to the desert folk … the search won’t stop until they’re found.’ 
21.0,108,text_content,"Baron looked up at Piter who stood at Leto’s shoulder. ‘Piter doesn’t have all his tools here, but I’m sure he could improvise.’ "
21.0,109,text_content,"‘Improvisation is sometimes the best, Baron.’ "
21.0,110,text_content,"‘That silky, insinuating voice!’ Leto heard it at his ear. "
21.0,111,text_content,ring is missing. Does the boy have it?’ 
21.0,112,text_content,"The Baron looked up, stared into Leto’s eyes. "
21.0,113,text_content,"agree they’re sometimes the best, but it’s not good that ‘you’ should be subjected to such things.’ "
21.0,114,text_content,"the pattern of pus-white blisters on naked skin, eh, Baron?’ "
21.0,115,text_content,"‘Exquisite,’ the Baron said, and his voice sounded sour. "
21.0,116,text_content,"‘Those touching fingers!’ Leto watched the fat hands, the glittering jewels on baby-fat hands – their compulsive wandering. "
21.0,117,text_content,The sounds of agony coming through the door behind him gnawed at the Duke’s nerves. ‘Who is it they caught?’ he wondered. ‘Could it have been Idaho?’ 
21.0,118,text_content,"‘Believe me, cher cousin,’ the Baron said. ‘I do not want it to come to this.’ "
21.0,119,text_content,"‘You think of nerve couriers racing to summon help that cannot come,’ Piter said. ‘There’s artistry in this, you know.’ "
21.0,120,text_content,"‘You’re a superb artist,’ the Baron growled. ‘Now, have the decency to be silent.’ "
21.0,121,text_content,"Leto suddenly recalled a thing Gurney Halleck had said once, seeing a picture of the Baron: ‘“ ‘And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea … and upon his heads the name of blasphemy’.”’ "
21.0,122,text_content,"‘We waste time, Baron,’ Piter said. "
21.0,123,text_content,‘Perhaps.’ 
21.0,124,text_content,"The Baron nodded. You know, my dear Leto, you’ll tell us in the end where they are. There’s a level of pain that’ll buy you.’ "
21.0,125,text_content,"‘He’s most likely correct,’ Leto thought. ‘Were it not for the tooth … and the fact that I truly don’t know where they are.’ "
21.0,126,text_content,"The Baron picked up a sliver of meat, pressed the morsel into his mouth, chewed slowly, swallowed. ‘We must try a new tack,’ he thought. "
21.0,127,text_content,"‘Observe this prize person who denies he’s for hire,’ the Baron said. ‘Observe him, Piter.’ "
21.0,128,text_content,how he dies now?’ 
21.0,129,text_content,The frog sounds in the background stopped. 
21.0,130,text_content,how much hell there was so near him – only a nerve’s thickness away. 
21.0,131,text_content,"as a surgeon exercising endless supple scissor dissections – cutting away the masks from fools, exposing the hell beneath. "
21.0,132,text_content,"‘Rabbits, all of them!’ "
21.0,133,text_content,And how they cowered when they saw the carnivore! 
21.0,134,text_content,haze. 
21.0,135,text_content,Duke clamped his mouth shut. 
21.0,136,text_content,‘How he fears me!’ the Baron thought. 
21.0,137,text_content,Leto heard a gasp beside his ear – the silky-voiced one: Piter. 
21.0,138,text_content,"‘It got him, too!’ "
21.0,139,text_content,‘Piter! What’s wrong?’ 
21.0,140,text_content,The rumbling voice was far away. 
21.0,141,text_content,"terrified eyes – blue within blue, the eyes – all compressed around him in ruined symmetry. "
21.0,142,text_content,"mind was a bin without end, catching everything. Everything that had ever been: every shout, every whisper, every … silence. "
21.0,143,text_content,One thought remained to him. Leto saw it in formless light on rays of black: ‘The day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes.’ The thought struck him with a sense of fullness he knew he could never explain. 
21.0,144,text_content,Silence. 
21.0,145,text_content,"of dead men. His senses took in guards swarming around him. ‘Did I breathe it?’ he asked himself. ‘Whatever it was in there, did it get me, too?’ "
21.0,146,text_content,Sounds returned to him … and reason. He heard someone shouting orders – gas masks … keep a door closed … get blowers going. 
21.0,147,text_content,"‘The others fell quickly,’ he thought. I’m still standing. I’m still breathing. ‘Merciless hell! That was close!’ "
21.0,148,text_content,captain darting forward into his own doom. 
21.0,149,text_content,Chance and the warning in a dying man’s gasp – these had saved him. 
21.0,150,text_content,the poison snooper over the table – until it was too late. How? 
21.0,151,text_content,"‘Well, no matter now,’ the Baron thought, his mind firming. ‘The next guard captain will begin by finding answers to these questions.’ "
21.0,152,text_content,reaction. 
21.0,153,text_content,‘Would the Baron be angry?’ 
21.0,154,text_content,And the Baron realized only a few seconds had passed since his flight from that terrible room. 
21.0,155,text_content,away toward the noises around the corner to their right. 
21.0,156,text_content,mouth. He looked like some water creature misplaced among those who walked the land. 
21.0,157,text_content,"the drug-music combination that played itself in the deepest consciousness. A useful item of information, that. "
21.0,158,text_content,head. ‘None of the stuff escaped. We have the room cleaned out now. What are your orders?’ 
21.0,159,text_content,"The Baron recognized the man’s voice – the one who’d been shouting orders. ‘Efficient, this corporal,’ he thought. "
21.0,160,text_content,‘They’re all dead in there?’ the Baron asked. 
21.0,161,text_content,"‘Yes, m’Lord.’ "
21.0,162,text_content,"‘Well, we must adjust,’ the Baron thought. "
21.0,163,text_content,lesson to be learned from the fate of your predecessor.’ 
21.0,164,text_content,The Baron watched the awareness grow in his newly promoted guardsman. Nefud knew he’d never again be without his semuta.

21.0,168,text_content,"The Baron couldn’t place the colonel bashar’s face: thin with mouth like a slash in leather, twin ink spots for eyes. "
21.0,169,text_content,"‘Get your hands off me, you pack of carrion-eaters!’ the man roared, and he dashed the guards aside. "

21.0,173,text_content,was perfectly capable of turning on the Harkonnens and overcoming them. 
21.0,174,text_content,Duke before I could discuss his fate with you. We will discuss it now.’ 
21.0,175,text_content,"‘I must not lose face before my men,’ the Baron thought. "
21.0,176,text_content,"‘So?’ It was a coldly controlled word, and the Baron felt proud of it. "
21.0,177,text_content,"‘My Emperor has charged me to make certain his royal cousin dies cleanly without agony,’ the colonel bashar said. "
21.0,178,text_content,"‘Such were the Imperial orders to me,’ the Baron lied. ‘Did you think I’d disobey?’ "
21.0,179,text_content,"‘I’m to report to my Emperor what I see with my own eyes,’ the Sardaukar said. "
21.0,180,text_content,"‘The Duke’s already dead,’ the Baron snapped, and he waved a hand to dismiss the fellow. "
21.0,181,text_content,‘How?’ he growled. 
21.0,182,text_content,‘Really!’ the Baron thought. ‘This is too much.’ 
21.0,183,text_content,"‘By his own hand, if you must know,’ the Baron said. ‘He took poison.’ "
21.0,184,text_content,"‘I will see the body now,’ the colonel bashar said. "
21.0,185,text_content,The Baron raised his gaze to the ceiling in feigned exasperation while his thoughts raced. ‘Damnation! This sharp-eyed Sardaukar will see the room before a thing’s been changed!’ 
21.0,186,text_content,"‘Now,’ the Sardaukar growled. ‘I’ll see it with my own eyes.’ "
21.0,187,text_content,the dead Duke across from it with destruction around him. 
21.0,188,text_content,No preventing it at all. 
21.0,189,text_content,"‘I’ll not be put off,’ the colonel bashar snarled. "
21.0,190,text_content,"He nodded to Nefud. ‘The colonel bashar is to see everything, at once. Take him in by the door where you stood, Nefud.’ "
21.0,191,text_content,"‘This way, sir,’ Nefud said. "
21.0,192,text_content,"Slowly, insolently, the Sardaukar moved around the Baron, shouldered a way through the guardsmen. "
21.0,193,text_content,"‘Insufferable,’ the Baron thought. ‘Now, the Emperor will know how I slipped up. He’ll recognize it as a sign of weakness.’ "
21.0,194,text_content,of the Harkonnen spice stores there. 
21.0,195,text_content,‘Damn that slippery Duke!’ 
21.0,196,text_content,"The Baron watched the retreating backs – the arrogant Sardaukar and the stocky, efficient Nefud. "
21.0,197,text_content,with him.’ 
21.0,198,text_content,The Baron sighed. 
21.0,199,text_content,‘And I must send at once to Tleilax for a new Mentat. They undoubtedly have the new one ready for me by now.’ 
21.0,200,text_content,One of the guardsmen beside him coughed. 
21.0,201,text_content,The Baron turned toward the man. ‘I am hungry.’ 
21.0,202,text_content,"‘Yes, m’Lord.’ "
21.0,203,text_content,"‘And I wish to be diverted while you’re clearing out that room and studying its secrets for me,’ the Baron rumbled. "
21.0,204,text_content,The guardsman lowered his eyes. ‘What diversion does m’Lord wish?’ 
21.0,205,text_content,eyes. Drug him well. I don’t feel like wrestling.’ 
21.0,206,text_content,"‘Yes, m’Lord.’ "
21.0,207,text_content,"The Baron turned away, began moving with his bouncing, suspensor-buoyed pace toward his chambers. ‘Yes,’ he thought. ‘The one with the lovely eyes, the one who looks so much like the young Paul Atreides.’ "

21.0,79,text_content,"He turned away from her, looking out into the night. ‘Why can’t I mourn?’ he wondered. He felt that every fiber of his being craved this release, but it would be denied him forever. "

21.0,95,text_content,Sobs shook her. 
21.0,96,text_content,"Paul heard his mother’s grief and felt the emptiness within himself. ‘I have no grief,’ he thought. ‘Why? Why?’ He felt the inability to grieve as a terrible flaw. "

21.0,132,text_content,"‘There’s no more childhood in his voice,’ she thought. And she said: ‘I hoped the thing any parent hopes – that you’d be … superior, different.’ "

21.0,139,text_content,"‘But not the training,’ he said. ‘Not the things that … awakened … the sleeper.’ "
21.0,140,text_content,‘Sleeper?’ 
21.0,141,text_content,‘It’s here.’ He put a hand on his head and then to his breast. ‘In me. It goes on and on and on and on and—’ 
21.0,142,text_content,‘Paul!’ 
21.0,143,text_content,She had heard the hysteria edging his voice.

21.0,154,text_content,"But he spoke again, and she heard the iron control return to him: ‘We’re trapped here.’ "

21.0,170,text_content,"He was, indeed, no longer a child. "
21.0,171,text_content,"The underlying import of his words began to take over in her mind, pushing all else aside. Paul could see ahead, a way of escape for them. "

21.0,181,text_content,I’ve arrived before my time. And ‘they’ don’t know it.’ 
21.0,182,text_content,Jessica pressed her hands to her mouth.

21.0,184,text_content,"She felt exposed and naked before him, realizing then that he saw her with eyes from which little could be hidden. And ‘that,’ she knew, was the basis of her fear. "

22.0,26,text_content,"‘An entire planet full of spice,’ she said. ‘How can you hit them there?’ "
22.0,27,text_content,"She heard him stirring, the sound of their pack being dragged across the tent floor. "

22.0,36,text_content,She thought of the compaction tool and the other strange instruments in the pack. Each of these tools suddenly stood in her mind as a sign of mysterious dangers. 
22.0,37,text_content,She felt then a hot breeze from surface sand touch her cheeks where they were exposed above the filter.

23.0,39,text_content,Hawat sighed. 
23.0,40,text_content,He could not recall ever before being this tired. It was a muscle weariness that energy pills were unable to ease.

23.0,46,text_content,"‘‘Fremen don’t like to say no,’’ Idaho had told him once. "
23.0,47,text_content,Hawat said: ‘You haven’t told me whether your people can help my wounded.’

23.0,49,text_content,‘The same damned answer every time!’ 
23.0,50,text_content,‘We know they’re wounded!’ Hawat snapped. ‘That’s not the—’

23.0,52,text_content,"‘We haven’t talked about water,’ Hawat said. ‘We—’ "
23.0,53,text_content,"‘I can understand your reluctance,’ the Fremen said. ‘They are your friends, your tribesmen. Do you have water?’ "

23.0,56,text_content,‘Can we hire your help?’ 
23.0,57,text_content,The Fremen shrugged. You have no water.’ He glanced at the group behind Hawat. ‘How many of your wounded would you spend?’

23.0,59,text_content,"‘I am Thufir Hawat,’ he said. ‘I can speak for my Duke. I will make promissory commitment now for your help. I wish a limited form of help, preserving my force long enough only to kill a traitor who thinks herself beyond vengeance.’ "
23.0,60,text_content,‘You wish our siding in a vendetta?’ 
23.0,61,text_content,‘The vendetta I’ll handle myself. I wish to be freed of responsibility for my wounded that I may get about it.’

23.0,65,text_content,‘What do you fear?’ the Fremen demanded. 
23.0,66,text_content,‘These people and their disconcerting directness!’ Hawat spoke cautiously. ‘There’s a price on my head.’ 
23.0,67,text_content,Harkonnens have not water enough to buy the smallest child among us.’ 
23.0,68,text_content,"‘But they had the price of Guild passage for more than two thousand fighting ships,’ Hawat thought. And the size of that price still staggered him. "
23.0,69,text_content,"‘We both fight Harkonnens,’ Hawat said. ‘Should we not share the problems and ways of meeting the battle issue?’ "

23.0,73,text_content,"‘I must be cautious,’ Hawat told himself. ‘There’s a thing here that’s not understood.’ "
23.0,74,text_content,"He said: ‘Will you show me your way, the Arrakeen way?’ "
23.0,75,text_content,"You have no stillsuits, no water. You will not last long.’ "
23.0,76,text_content,"‘The ways of Arrakis don’t come easily,’ Hawat said. "

23.0,81,text_content,‘Have you word of my Duke or his son?’ 
23.0,82,text_content,Unreadable blue eyes stared upward into Hawat’s. ‘Word?’ 
23.0,83,text_content,‘Their fate!’ Hawat snapped. 
23.0,84,text_content,that is in Liet’s hands. Liet has not said.’ 
23.0,85,text_content,"‘I knew the answer without asking,’ Hawat thought. "
23.0,86,text_content,"in their expressions: there was no returning to Caladan for them, and now Arrakis was lost. "
23.0,87,text_content,Hawat turned back to the Fremen. ‘Have you heard of Duncan Idaho?’ 
23.0,88,text_content,"‘He was in the great house when the shield went down,’ the Fremen said. ‘This I’ve heard … no more.’ "
23.0,89,text_content,how a Bene Gesserit witch thinks … if you can call it thinking?’ 
23.0,90,text_content,Hawat tried to swallow in a dry throat. When will you hear about the boy?’ 
23.0,91,text_content,"‘We know little of what happens in Arrakeen,’ the Fremen said. He shrugged. ‘Who knows?’ "
23.0,92,text_content,‘You have ways of finding out?’ 
23.0,93,text_content,the Harkonnens used?’ 
23.0,94,text_content,"‘The artillery,’ Hawat thought bitterly. ‘Who could have guessed they’d use artillery in this day of shields?’ "

23.0,96,text_content,"‘Any man who retreats into a cave which has only one opening deserves to die,’ the Fremen said. "
23.0,97,text_content,‘Why do you ask about these weapons?’ 
23.0,98,text_content,‘Liet wishes it.’ 
23.0,99,text_content,‘Is that what he wants from us?’ Hawat wondered. He said: ‘Did you come here seeking information about the big guns?’ 
23.0,100,text_content,‘Liet wished to see one of the weapons for himself.’ 
23.0,101,text_content,"‘Then you should just go take one,’ Hawat sneered. "
23.0,102,text_content,himself if he wishes. But I doubt he’ll want to: the weapon is not a very good one. Poor design for Arrakis.’ 
23.0,103,text_content,‘You … took one?’ Hawat asked. 
23.0,104,text_content,"‘It was a good fight,’ the Fremen said. ‘We lost only two men and spilled the water from more than a hundred of theirs.’ "
23.0,105,text_content,"‘There were Sardaukar at every gun,’ Hawat thought. ‘This desert madman speaks casually of losing only two men against Sardaukar!’ "
23.0,106,text_content,good fighters.’ 
23.0,107,text_content,"One of Hawat’s men limped forward, looked down at the squatting Fremen. ‘Are you talking about Sardaukar?’ "
23.0,108,text_content,"‘He’s talking about Sardaukar,’ Hawat said. "
23.0,109,text_content,night indeed. Sardaukar. Which legion? Do you know?’ 
23.0,110,text_content,"‘We … don’t know,’ Hawat said. "
23.0,111,text_content,"‘Sardaukar,’ the Fremen mused. Yet they wear Harkonnen clothing. Is this not strange?’ "
23.0,112,text_content,"‘The Emperor does not wish it known he fights against a Great House,’ Hawat said. "
23.0,113,text_content,‘‘But you’ know they are Sardaukar.’

23.0,116,text_content,"Hawat’s aide spoke slowly, disbelief in every word: ‘You … ‘captured’ Sardaukar?’ "
23.0,117,text_content,"‘Only three of them,’ the Fremen said. ‘They fought well.’ "
23.0,118,text_content,"‘If only we’d had the time to link up with these Fremen,’ Hawat thought. It was a sour lament in his mind. ‘If only we could’ve trained them and armed them. Great Mother, what a fighting force we’d have had!’ "

23.0,137,text_content,One of Hawat’s men shouted: ‘Where they going with Arkie? He was—’

23.0,143,text_content,"‘They’re going to render Arkie down for his water,’ the man with the lasgun snarled. "
23.0,144,text_content,‘Is it that your men wish to attend the ceremony?’ the Fremen asked. 
23.0,145,text_content,"‘He doesn’t even see the problem,’ Hawat thought. The naïveté of the Fremen was frightening. "

23.0,148,text_content,Hawat spoke quickly as the man with the lasgun advanced another step. ‘Will you now help our wounded?’

23.0,150,text_content,The man with the lasgun hesitated. 
23.0,151,text_content,Hawat’s aide said: ‘Are we buying help with Arkie’s … water?’ 
23.0,152,text_content,"‘Not buying,’ Hawat said. ‘We’ve joined these people.’ "
23.0,153,text_content,"‘Customs differ,’ one of his men muttered. "
23.0,154,text_content,Hawat began to relax.

23.0,161,text_content,The bat swooped away beside the cliff and was lost to sight.

23.0,163,text_content,"‘It’s known that we retreated this direction,’ Hawat said. "
23.0,164,text_content,"‘One should never presume one is the sole object of a hunt,’ the Fremen said. ‘Watch the other side of the basin. You will see a thing.’ "

23.0,188,text_content,"On the distant dune, a Fremen waved a square of green cloth: once … twice. "

24.0,88,text_content,"‘Perhaps,’ Paul agreed. Yet perhaps not. Superstitions sometimes have strange roots and stranger branchings.’ "
24.0,89,text_content,"‘You have a plan,’ Kynes said. ‘This much is obvious … ‘Sire.’’ "
24.0,90,text_content,‘Could your Fremen provide me with proof positive that the Sardaukar are here in Harkonnen uniform?’ 
24.0,91,text_content,‘Quite likely.’ 
24.0,92,text_content,Let him answer there where—’ 
24.0,93,text_content,‘Paul!’ said Jessica. 
24.0,94,text_content,between the Imperium and the Great Houses.’ 
24.0,95,text_content,"‘Chaos,’Jessica said. "
24.0,96,text_content,"‘But I’d present my case to the Emperor,’ Paul said, ‘and give him an alternative to chaos.’ "
24.0,97,text_content,Jessica spoke in a dry tone: ‘Blackmail?’ 
24.0,98,text_content,"Emperor has no sons, only daughters.’ "
24.0,99,text_content,‘You’d aim for the throne?’Jessica asked. 
24.0,100,text_content,he’ll not risk that.’ 
24.0,101,text_content,"‘This is a desperate gamble you propose,’ Kynes said. "
24.0,102,text_content,– the Sardaukar picking them off one by one. That’s why there ‘is’ a Landsraad. This is the glue of the Great Convention. Only in union do they match the Imperial forces.’ 
24.0,103,text_content,‘But they’re—’ 
24.0,104,text_content,out of the herd and killed.’ 
24.0,105,text_content,Kynes spoke to Jessica: ‘Would his plan work?’ 
24.0,106,text_content,"‘I’m no Mentat,’Jessica said. "
24.0,107,text_content,‘But you are Bene Gesserit.’ 
24.0,108,text_content,depends as much upon execution as it does upon concept.’ 
24.0,109,text_content,"‘“Law is the ultimate science,” ‘Paul quoted. ‘Thus it reads above the Emperor’s door. I propose to show him law.’ "
24.0,110,text_content,"‘And I’m not sure I could trust the person who conceived this plan,’ Kynes said. ‘Arrakis has its own plan that we—’ "
24.0,111,text_content,support.’ 
24.0,112,text_content,"Kynes stiffened. ‘My loyalty’s not for sale, ‘Sire.’’ "
24.0,113,text_content,commanding appearance. A harsh smile touched Paul’s lips and he said: ‘Well spoken. I apologize.’ 
24.0,114,text_content,"Kynes met Paul’s stare and, presently, said: ‘No Harkonnen ever admitted error. Perhaps you’re not like them, Atreides.’ "
24.0,115,text_content,For your loyalty I offer ‘my’ loyalty to you … totally.’ 
24.0,116,text_content,"‘My son has the Atreides sincerity,’ Jessica thought. ‘He has that tremendous, almost naive honor – and what a powerful force that truly is.’ "
24.0,117,text_content,She saw that Paul’s words had shaken Kynes. 
24.0,118,text_content,"‘This is nonsense,’ Kynes said. ‘You’re just a boy and—’ "
24.0,119,text_content,"‘I’m the Duke,’ Paul said. ‘I’m an Atreides. No Atreides has ever broken such a bond.’ "
24.0,120,text_content,Kynes swallowed. 
24.0,121,text_content,"‘When I say totally,’ Paul said, ‘I mean without reservation. I would give my life for you.’ "
24.0,122,text_content,"to a man, to a superior. Now Kynes meant the word. "
24.0,123,text_content,"‘In this moment he’d give his life for Paul,’ she thought. ‘How do the Atreides accomplish this so quickly, so easily?’ "
24.0,124,text_content,"‘I know you mean this,’ Kynes said. ‘Yet the Harkon—’ "
24.0,125,text_content,in the passage. 
24.0,126,text_content,"of a stunner repelled by the shield. Idaho’s blades were through it all, flick-flicking, red dripping from them. "
24.0,127,text_content,Then Kynes was beside Paul and they threw their weight against the door. 
24.0,128,text_content,black goat hair with a red blossom of death in it. Then the door was closed and there came a snick as Kynes threw the bolts. 
24.0,129,text_content,"‘I appear to’ve decided,’ Kynes said. "
24.0,130,text_content,in her eyes. 
24.0,131,text_content,"‘I should’ve suspected trouble when the coffee failed to arrive,’ Kynes said. "
24.0,132,text_content,"‘You’ve a bolt hole out of here,’ Paul said. ‘Shall we use it?’ "
24.0,133,text_content,"Kynes took a deep breath, said: ‘This door should hold for at least twenty minutes against all but a lasgun.’ "
24.0,134,text_content,"‘They’ll not use a lasgun for fear we’ve shields on this side,’ Paul said. "
24.0,135,text_content,"‘Those were Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniform,’ Jessica whispered. "
24.0,136,text_content,"They could hear pounding on the door now, rhythmic blows. "
24.0,137,text_content,"manipulated a handle within it. The entire wall of cabinets swung open to expose the black mouth of a tunnel. ‘This door also is plasteel,’ Kynes said. "
24.0,138,text_content,"‘You were well prepared,’Jessica said. "
24.0,139,text_content,"‘We lived under the Harkonnens for eighty years,’ Kynes said. He herded them into the darkness, closed the door. "
24.0,140,text_content,"In the sudden blackness, Jessica saw a luminous arrow on the floor ahead of her. "
24.0,141,text_content,"top of it, ride with it. My people have done this in stealing ’thopters. If you stay high in the storm you’ll survive.’ "
24.0,142,text_content,‘What of you?’ Paul asked. 
24.0,143,text_content,"‘I’ll try to escape another way. If I’m captured … well, I’m still Imperial Planetologist. I can say I was your captive.’ "
24.0,144,text_content,"‘Running like cowards,’ Paul thought. ‘But how else can I live to avenge my father?’ He turned to face the door. "
24.0,145,text_content,"Jessica heard him move, said: ‘Duncan’s dead, Paul. You saw the wound. You can do nothing for him.’ "
24.0,146,text_content,"‘I’ll take full payment for them all one day,’ Paul said. "
24.0,147,text_content,"‘Not unless you hurry now,’ Kynes said. "
24.0,148,text_content,Paul felt the man’s hand on his shoulder. 
24.0,149,text_content,"‘Where will we meet, Kynes?’ Paul asked. "
24.0,150,text_content,"‘I’ll send the Fremen searching for you. The storm’s path is known. Hurry now, and the Great Mother give you speed and luck.’ "
24.0,151,text_content,"They heard him go, a scrambling in the blackness. "
24.0,152,text_content,"Jessica found Paul’s hand, pulled him gently. ‘We must not get separated,’ she said. "
24.0,153,text_content,‘Yes.’ 
24.0,154,text_content,"He followed her across the first arrow, seeing it go black as they touched it. Another arrow beckoned ahead. "
24.0,155,text_content,"They crossed it, saw it extinguish itself, saw another arrow ahead. "
24.0,156,text_content,They were running now. 
24.0,157,text_content,"‘Plans within plans within plans within plans,’ Jessica thought. ‘Have we become part of someone else’s plan now?’ "
24.0,158,text_content,dark handle visible in its center. 
24.0,159,text_content,Paul pressed the handle. 
24.0,160,text_content,gray wall with a doorsign on it loomed beyond the aircraft. 
24.0,161,text_content,‘Where did Kynes go?’Jessica asked. 
24.0,162,text_content,reveal where we are if he’s captured. He won’t really know.’ 
24.0,163,text_content,"Paul drew her into the room, noting how their feet kicked up dust on the floor. "
24.0,164,text_content,"‘No one’s been here for a long time,’ he said. "
24.0,165,text_content,"‘He seemed confident the Fremen could find us,’ she said. "
24.0,166,text_content,‘I share that confidence.’ 
24.0,167,text_content,them to be thorough.’ 
24.0,168,text_content,"Jessica leaned against the craft’s other side, catching her breath. "
24.0,169,text_content,pointed right. ‘The storm we saw is that way.’ 
24.0,170,text_content,"paths up out of that valley, some might carry a Paul Atreides back into sight, but many would not. "
24.0,171,text_content,"‘The longer we wait the better prepared they’ll be,’ Jessica said. "
24.0,172,text_content,"‘Get in and strap yourself down,’ he said. "
24.0,173,text_content,reliance to prescient memory and it had weakened him for this particular emergency. 
24.0,174,text_content,never again to fall into that trap … if he lived through this. 
24.0,175,text_content,were armed. Turbines began their low hissing. 
24.0,176,text_content,‘Ready?’ he asked. 
24.0,177,text_content,‘Yes.’ 
24.0,178,text_content,He touched the remote control for lights. 
24.0,179,text_content,Darkness blanketed them. 
24.0,180,text_content,"of sand swished away to silence. A dusty breeze touched Paul’s cheeks. He closed his door, feeling the sudden pressure. "
24.0,181,text_content,"beyond, a suggestion of sand ripples. "
24.0,182,text_content,of its nest. Power surged from the jetpods as the wings locked into lift attitude. 
24.0,183,text_content,"yet exhilarated. ‘Now, Paul’s training is our only hope,’ she thought. ‘His youth and swiftness.’ "
24.0,184,text_content,the ribbon trail of the storm. 
24.0,185,text_content,in a tight bank. 
24.0,186,text_content,‘Jetflares behind us!’Jessica said. 
24.0,187,text_content,‘I saw them.’ 
24.0,188,text_content,He slammed the power arm forward. 
24.0,189,text_content,Beyond stretched moonlit fingernail shadows – dunes diminishing one into another. 
24.0,190,text_content,And above the horizon climbed the flat immensity of the storm like a wall against the stars. 
24.0,191,text_content,Something jarred the ’thopter. 
24.0,192,text_content,‘Shellburst!’ Jessica gasped. ‘They’re using some kind of projectile weapon.’ 
24.0,193,text_content,"She saw a sudden animal grin on Paul’s face. ‘They seem to be avoiding their lasguns,’ he said. "
24.0,194,text_content,‘But we’ve no shields!’ 
24.0,195,text_content,‘Do they know that?’ 
24.0,196,text_content,Again the ’thopter shuddered. 
24.0,197,text_content,Paul twisted to peer back. ‘Only one of them appears to be fast enough to keep up with us.’ 
24.0,198,text_content,"He returned his attention to their course, watching the storm wall grow high in front of them. It loomed like a tangible solid. "
24.0,199,text_content,"‘Projectile launchers, rockets, all the ancient weaponry – that’s one thing we’ll give the Fremen,’ Paul whispered. "
24.0,200,text_content,"‘The storm,’Jessica said. ‘Hadn’t you better turn?’ "
24.0,201,text_content,‘What about the ship behind us?’ 
24.0,202,text_content,‘He’s pulling up.’ 
24.0,203,text_content,‘Now!’ 
24.0,204,text_content,G-force. 
24.0,205,text_content,"moon. The aircraft became a long, horizontal whisper of darkness lighted only by the green luminosity of the instrument panel. "
24.0,206,text_content,"him chop the power, felt the ship buck. The metal around them hissed and trembled. "
24.0,207,text_content,‘Sand!’Jessica shouted. 
24.0,208,text_content,She saw the negative shake of his head in the light from the panel. ‘Not much sand this high.’ 
24.0,209,text_content,But she could feel them sinking deeper into the maelstrom. 
24.0,210,text_content,"gliding by instinct, fighting for altitude. "
24.0,211,text_content,The sound of their passage diminished. 
24.0,212,text_content,back to level flight. 
24.0,213,text_content,"windows, a rumbling hiss reminded her of the powers around them. "
24.0,214,text_content,"‘Winds to seven or eight hundred kilometers an hour,’ she thought. Adrenalin edginess gnawed at her. ‘I must not fear,’ she told herself, mouthing the words of the Bene Gesserit litany. ‘Fear is the mind-killer.’ "
24.0,215,text_content,Slowly her long years of training prevailed. 
24.0,216,text_content,Calmness returned. 
24.0,217,text_content,We’ll have to ride it out.’ 
24.0,218,text_content,"Calmness drained out of her. Jessica felt her teeth chattering, clamped them together. Then she heard Paul’s voice, low and controlled, reciting the litany: "

25.0,9,text_content,"‘I have a full report,’ Nefud said. "
25.0,10,text_content,"‘Let him sweat a little,’ the Baron thought. ‘One must always keep the tools of statecraft sharp and ready. Power and fear – sharp and ready.’ "
25.0,11,text_content,‘Have you seen their bodies?’ the Baron rumbled. 
25.0,12,text_content,Nefud hesitated. 
25.0,13,text_content,‘Well?’ 
25.0,14,text_content,the pursuit.’ 
25.0,15,text_content,as Nefud swallowed. 
25.0,16,text_content,‘You have seen the bodies?’ the Baron asked. 
25.0,17,text_content,‘M’Lord—’ 
25.0,18,text_content,"Do you think I’ll praise you for such stupidity, give you another promotion?’ "
25.0,19,text_content,Nefud’s face went bone pale. 
25.0,20,text_content,"‘Look at that chicken,’ the Baron thought. ‘I am surrounded by such useless clods. If I scattered sand before this creature and told him it was grain, he’d peck at it.’ "
25.0,21,text_content,"‘The man Idaho led us to them, then?’ the Baron asked. "
25.0,22,text_content,"‘Yes, m’Lord!’ "
25.0,23,text_content,"‘Look how he blurts out his answer,’ the Baron thought. He said: ‘They were attempting to flee to the Fremen, eh?’ "
25.0,24,text_content,"‘Yes, m’Lord.’ "
25.0,25,text_content,‘Is there more to this … report?’

25.0,29,text_content,‘How many did we lose?’ 
25.0,30,text_content,"‘I’m … ah, not sure yet, m’Lord.’ "
25.0,31,text_content,"‘He’s lying,’ the Baron thought. ‘It must’ve been pretty bad.’ "
25.0,32,text_content,"‘The Imperial lackey, this Kynes,’ the Baron said. ‘He was playing a double game, eh?’ "
25.0,33,text_content,"‘I’d stake my reputation on it, m’Lord.’ "
25.0,34,text_content,‘His reputation!’ 
25.0,35,text_content,"‘Have the man killed,’ the Baron said. "
25.0,36,text_content,"‘M’Lord! Kynes is the ‘Imperial’ Planetologist, His Majesty’s own serv—’ "
25.0,37,text_content,"‘Make it look like an accident, then!’ "
25.0,38,text_content,"‘M’Lord, there were Sardaukar with our forces in the subjugation of this Fremen nest. They have Kynes in custody now.’ "
25.0,39,text_content,‘Get him away from them. Say I wish to question him.’ 
25.0,40,text_content,‘If they demur?’ 
25.0,41,text_content,‘They will not if you handle it correctly.’ 
25.0,42,text_content,"Nefud swallowed. ‘Yes, m’Lord.’ "
25.0,43,text_content,"‘The man must die,’ the Baron rumbled. ‘He tried to help my enemies.’ "
25.0,44,text_content,Nefud shifted from one foot to the other. 
25.0,45,text_content,‘Well?’

25.0,56,text_content,"‘Let him think she’s alive, then.’ "

25.0,62,text_content,‘Is Hawat hungry? Thirsty?’ 
25.0,63,text_content,"‘M’Lord, Hawat’s still in the hands of the Sardaukar!’ "
25.0,64,text_content,way. Yes. I do believe it. You will remind the Sardaukar commander of my renown at obtaining information from reluctant subjects.’ 
25.0,65,text_content,"Nefud looked unhappy. ‘Yes, m’Lord.’ "
25.0,66,text_content,"against the other. He can understand that much, I think.’ "
25.0,67,text_content,"‘Yes, m’Lord.’ "
25.0,68,text_content,‘And once we have them in our hands …’ The Baron nodded. 
25.0,69,text_content,"‘M’Lord, the Sardaukar will want an observer with you during any … questioning.’ "
25.0,70,text_content,"‘I’m sure we can produce an emergency to draw off any unwanted observers, Nefud.’ "
25.0,71,text_content,"‘I understand, m’Lord. That’s when Kynes can have his accident.’ "
25.0,72,text_content,"‘Both Kynes and Hawat will have accidents then, Nefud. But only Kynes will have a real accident. It’s Hawat I want. Ah, yes.’ "
25.0,73,text_content,"Nefud blinked, swallowed. He appeared about to ask a question, but remained silent. "
25.0,74,text_content,the residual poison developed by the late Piter de Vries. ‘And you’ will see that the antidote becomes a regular part of Hawat’s diet from this point on … unless I say otherwise.’ 
25.0,75,text_content,"‘The antidote, yes.’ Nefud shook his head. ‘But—’ "
25.0,76,text_content,"‘Don’t be dense, Nefud. The Duke almost killed me with that poison-capsule tooth. The gas he exhaled into my presence deprived me of my most valuable Mentat, Piter. I need a replacement.’ "
25.0,77,text_content,‘Hawat?’ 
25.0,78,text_content,‘Hawat.’ 
25.0,79,text_content,‘But—’ 
25.0,80,text_content,Thufir Hawat.’ 
25.0,81,text_content,"‘Woo him. Yes, m’Lord.’ "
25.0,82,text_content,"Nefud. The truth is a powerful weapon. We know how we overwhelmed the Atreides. Hawat knows, too. We did it with wealth.’ "
25.0,83,text_content,"‘With wealth. Yes, m’Lord.’ "
25.0,84,text_content,will not betray itself to a poison snooper. Hawat can scan his food as he pleases and detect no trace of poison.’

25.0,87,text_content,"Nefud swallowed. Yes, m’Lord.’ "
25.0,88,text_content,‘Then get busy. Find the Sardaukar commander and set things in motion.’ 
25.0,89,text_content,"‘At once, m’Lord.’ Nefud bowed, turned, and hurried away. "

25.0,105,text_content,Rabban blinked. ‘But I thought you were going to advance Piter de Vries to the—’

25.0,107,text_content,‘Piter?’ 
25.0,108,text_content,‘Piter.’ 
25.0,109,text_content,"The Baron reactivated the doorfield, blanked it against all energy penetration. "
25.0,110,text_content,"‘You finally tired of him, eh?’ Rabban asked. "

25.0,113,text_content,Seldom to the point of death unless there were outrageous profit or provocation in it. But family punishments could be painful. 
25.0,114,text_content,"‘Forgive me, m’Lord Baron,’ Rabban said. He lowered his eyes as much to hide his own anger as to show subservience. "
25.0,115,text_content,"‘You do not fool me, Rabban,’ the Baron said. "
25.0,116,text_content,"Rabban kept his eyes lowered, swallowed. "
25.0,117,text_content,"‘I make a point,’ the Baron said. ‘Never obliterate a man unthinkingly, the way an entire fief might do it through some ‘due process of law.’ Always do it for an overriding purpose – and ‘know your purpose!’’ "
25.0,118,text_content,"Anger spoke in Rabban: ‘But you obliterated the traitor, Yueh! I saw his body being carried out as I arrived last night.’ "
25.0,119,text_content,"Rabban stared at his uncle, suddenly frightened by the sound of those words. "
25.0,120,text_content,"Strength poured into the Baron’s voice.’ ‘I’ suborned a doctor of the Suk School! The ‘Inner’ School! You hear, boy? But that’s a wild sort of weapon to leave lying about. I didn’t obliterate him casually.’ "
25.0,121,text_content,‘Does the Emperor know you suborned a Suk doctor?’ 
25.0,122,text_content,"‘That was a penetrating question,’ the Baron thought. ‘Have I misjudged this nephew?’ "

25.0,124,text_content,"‘Ah-h-h, I see,’ Rabban murmured. "
25.0,125,text_content,"And the Baron thought: ‘Indeed, I hope you do see. I hope you do see how vital it is that this remain secret.’ The Baron suddenly wondered at himself. ‘Why did I do that? Why did I boast to this fool nephew of mine – the nephew I must use and discard?’ The Baron felt anger at himself. He felt betrayed. "

25.0,135,text_content,"Rabban opened his mouth, closed it without speaking. "
25.0,136,text_content,"long ago. You should know, Rabban, that ‘we’ bore the entire brunt of it. We even paid for transport of the Sardaukar.’ "

25.0,139,text_content,‘Insufferable!’ 
25.0,140,text_content,"‘Income, then,’ Rabban said. "
25.0,141,text_content,"The Baron lowered his arm, made a fist. ‘You must squeeze.’ "
25.0,142,text_content,‘And I may do anything I wish as long as I squeeze?’ 
25.0,143,text_content,‘Anything.’ 
25.0,144,text_content,"‘The cannons you brought,’ Rabban said. ‘Could I—’ "
25.0,145,text_content,"‘I’m removing them,’ the Baron said. "
25.0,146,text_content,‘But you—’ 
25.0,147,text_content,this abominable planet. Our cannon merely sealed them in.’ 
25.0,148,text_content,‘The Fremen don’t use shields.’ 
25.0,149,text_content,‘You may keep some lasguns if you wish.’

25.0,151,text_content,‘As long as you squeeze.’

25.0,154,text_content,difficult to count a population scattered among sinks and pans the way they are here. And when you consider the Fremen of—’ 
25.0,155,text_content,‘The Fremen aren’t worth considering!’ 
25.0,156,text_content,"‘Forgive me, m’Lord, but the Sardaukar believe otherwise.’ "
25.0,157,text_content,"The Baron hesitated, staring at his nephew. You know something?’ "
25.0,158,text_content,of here and wiped it out.’ 
25.0,159,text_content,‘Wiped out a Sardaukar force?’ 
25.0,160,text_content,"‘Yes, m’Lord.’ "
25.0,161,text_content,‘Impossible!’ 
25.0,162,text_content,Rabban shrugged. 
25.0,163,text_content,"‘Fremen defeating Sardaukar,’ the Baron sneered. "

25.0,165,text_content,‘Ah-h-h-h-h-h.’ 
25.0,166,text_content,"The Baron nodded, smiling. "
25.0,167,text_content,"‘I believe the report,’ Rabban said. ‘You’ve no idea what a problem the Fremen were.’ "
25.0,168,text_content,Fremen. It’s the only possible answer.’ 
25.0,169,text_content,"Again, Rabban shrugged. ‘Well, the Sardaukar think they were Fremen. The Sardaukar already have launched a pogrom to wipe out all Fremen.’ "
25.0,170,text_content,‘Good!’ 
25.0,171,text_content,‘But—’ 
25.0,172,text_content,off hunting a few useless desert bands while we get the real prize!’ 
25.0,173,text_content,"‘M’Lord …’ Rabban hesitated, frowning. ‘I’ve always felt that we underestimated the Fremen, both in numbers and in—’ "
25.0,174,text_content,eh?’ 
25.0,175,text_content,"‘A great many, m’Lord.’ "
25.0,176,text_content,"‘They worry me, Rabban.’ "
25.0,177,text_content,‘Worry you?’ 
25.0,178,text_content,be most displeased. Have you any idea how displeased I’d be?’ 
25.0,179,text_content,Rabban swallowed. 
25.0,180,text_content,"though. That is the story. And any rumor that there were Sardaukar here, it must be laughed at.’ "
25.0,181,text_content,"‘As the Emperor wishes it,’ Rabban said. "
25.0,182,text_content,‘As the Emperor wishes it.’ 
25.0,183,text_content,‘What about the smugglers?’ 
25.0,184,text_content,that quarter … and taking other measures which I’m sure you can think of.’ 
25.0,185,text_content,"‘Yes, m’Lord.’ "
25.0,186,text_content,or mercy must you show them.’ 
25.0,187,text_content,‘Can one exterminate an entire planet?’ Rabban asked. 
25.0,188,text_content,‘Exterminate?’ Surprise showed in the swift turning of the Baron’s head. ‘Who said anything about exterminating?’ 
25.0,189,text_content,"‘Well, I presumed you were going to bring in new stock and—’ "
25.0,190,text_content,and thirsty.’ The Baron caressed his bulges beneath the suspensors. ‘Like me.’ 
25.0,191,text_content,"‘I see, m’Lord.’ "
25.0,192,text_content,Rabban swung his gaze left and right. 
25.0,193,text_content,"‘It’s all clear then, Nephew?’ "
25.0,194,text_content,"‘Except for one thing, Uncle: the planetologist, Kynes.’ "
25.0,195,text_content,"‘Ah, yes, Kynes.’ "
25.0,196,text_content,"‘He’s the Emperor’s man, m’Lord. He can come and go as he pleases. And he’s very close to the Fremen … married one.’ "
25.0,197,text_content,‘Kynes will be dead by tomorrow’s nightfall.’ 
25.0,198,text_content,"‘That’s dangerous work, Uncle, killing an Imperial servant.’ "
25.0,199,text_content,"‘Besides, you need never have feared Kynes would leave Arrakis. You’re forgetting that he’s addicted to the spice.’ "
25.0,200,text_content,‘Of course!’ 
25.0,201,text_content,"‘Those who know will do nothing to endanger their supply,’ the Baron said. ‘Kynes certainly must know.’ "
25.0,202,text_content,"‘I forgot,’ Rabban said. "
25.0,203,text_content,They stared at each other in silence. 
25.0,204,text_content,"private stuff, but that suicide raid by the Duke’s men got most of what we’d stored for sale.’ "

25.0,209,text_content,"The Baron deactivated his doorfield, watched his nephew out of sight. "
25.0,210,text_content,he’s the one we need. He’ll learn. And such a lovely body. Really a lovely boy.’

26.0,5,text_content,"‘I must find the right vortex,’ he thought. "
26.0,6,text_content,"For a long time now he had sensed the storm’s power diminishing, but still it shook them. He waited out another turbulence. "
26.0,7,text_content,The vortex began as an abrupt billowing that rattled the entire ship. Paul defied all fear to bank the ’thopter left. 
26.0,8,text_content,Jessica saw the maneuver on the attitude globe.

26.0,10,text_content,speck within a core of winding dust lighted by the second moon. 
26.0,11,text_content,a dry river into the desert – moon-gray motion growing smaller and smaller below as they rode the updraft. 
26.0,12,text_content,"‘We’re out of it,’Jessica whispered. "
26.0,13,text_content,Paul turned their craft away from the dust in swooping rhythm while he scanned the night sky. 
26.0,14,text_content,"‘We’ve given them the slip,’ he said. "
26.0,15,text_content,She felt reborn. 
26.0,16,text_content,"‘It was like the litany,’ she thought. ‘We faced it and did not resist. The storm passed through us and around us. It’s gone, but we remain.’ "
26.0,17,text_content,"‘I don’t like the sound of our wing motion,’ Paul said. ‘We suffered some damage in there.’ "
26.0,18,text_content,"the full view of his prescient vision. Yet, they had escaped, and Paul sensed himself trembling on the verge of a revelation. "
26.0,19,text_content,He shivered. 
26.0,20,text_content,words had a power of their own. 
26.0,21,text_content,‘‘I shall not fear’ …’ 
26.0,22,text_content,"Cause and effect: he was alive despite malignant forces, and he felt himself poised on a brink of self-awareness that could not have been without the litany’s magic. "
26.0,23,text_content,Words from the Orange Catholic Bible rang through his memory: ‘‘What senses do we lack that we cannot see or hear another world all around us?’’ 
26.0,24,text_content,"‘There’s rock all around,’Jessica said. "
26.0,25,text_content,"a hole somewhere, more of the storm’s doing. "
26.0,26,text_content,"‘Better set us down on sand,’ Jessica said. ‘The wings might not take full brake.’ "

26.0,29,text_content,"‘Run for those rocks the instant we’re stopped,’ Paul said. ‘I’ll take the pack.’ "
26.0,30,text_content,"‘Run for …’ She fell silent, nodded. ‘Worms.’ "
26.0,31,text_content,"‘Our friends, the worms,’ he corrected her. ‘They’ll get this ’thopter. There’ll be no evidence of where we landed.’ "
26.0,32,text_content,"‘How direct his thinking,’ she thought. "

26.0,35,text_content,"‘He’s killing our speed against the sand,’ Jessica thought, and permitted herself to admire his competence. "
26.0,36,text_content,‘Brace yourself!’ Paul warned. 
26.0,37,text_content,faster and faster. Wind screamed through the lapped coverts and primaries of the wings’ leaves.

26.0,40,text_content,‘Run!’ he ordered.

26.0,42,text_content,came out onto a sand ridge that curved away toward the rocks. 
26.0,43,text_content,"‘Follow the ridge,’ Paul ordered. ‘It’ll be faster.’ "
26.0,44,text_content,"They slogged toward the rocks, sand gripping their feet. "
26.0,45,text_content,"A new sound began to impress itself on them: a muted whisper, a hissing, an abrasive slithering. "
26.0,46,text_content,"‘Worm,’ Paul said. "
26.0,47,text_content,It grew louder. 
26.0,48,text_content,‘Faster!’ Paul gasped.

26.0,50,text_content,Breath came dry and gasping in their throats.

26.0,55,text_content,… how big.’ 
26.0,56,text_content,"‘Nor I,’Jessica breathed. "

26.0,61,text_content,"‘Whenever you’re ready,’ he said. "
26.0,62,text_content,"She pushed herself away from the rock, feeling her strength return. ‘Which direction?’ "
26.0,63,text_content,‘Where this ridge leads.’ He pointed. 
26.0,64,text_content,"‘Deep into the desert,’ she said. "
26.0,65,text_content,"‘The Fremen desert,’ Paul whispered. "
26.0,66,text_content,"by memory, and now failed of perfect registry when projected onto the real scene. The vision appeared to have shifted and approached him from a different angle while he remained motionless. "
26.0,67,text_content,"‘Idaho was with us in the vision,’ he remembered. ‘But now Idaho is dead.’ "
26.0,68,text_content,"‘Do you see a way to go?’ Jessica asked, mistaking his hesitation. "
26.0,69,text_content,"‘No,’ he said, ‘but we’ll go anyway.’ "
26.0,70,text_content,a moonlit floor of rock with benched ledges climbing away to the south. 
26.0,71,text_content,"Paul headed for the first ledge, clambered onto it. Jessica followed. "
26.0,72,text_content,The terrain enforced its own rhythms. They spoke only when necessary and then with the hoarse voices of their exertion. 
26.0,73,text_content,‘Careful here – this ledge is slippery with sand.’ 
26.0,74,text_content,‘Watch you don’t hit your head against this overhang.’ 
26.0,75,text_content,‘Stay below this ridge; the moon’s at our backs and it’d show our movement to anyone out there.’ 
26.0,76,text_content,"Paul stopped in a bight of rock, leaned the pack against a narrow ledge. "
26.0,77,text_content,it. 
26.0,78,text_content,"‘To stop,’ she thought. ‘To rest … truly rest.’ "
26.0,79,text_content,"It occurred to her that mercy was the ability to stop, if only for a moment. There was no mercy where there could be no stopping. "
26.0,80,text_content,"Paul pushed away from the rock ledge, turned, and climbed over a sloping surface. Jessica followed with a sigh. "
26.0,81,text_content,across this broken land. 
26.0,82,text_content,pea gravel or flaked rock or pea sand or sand itself or grit or dust or gossamer powder.

26.0,84,text_content,And the omnipresent sand patches dragged against their feet.

26.0,86,text_content,"curves and, in the distance, lifted to the misted gray blur of another escarpment. "
26.0,87,text_content,"‘Open desert,’ she said. "
26.0,88,text_content,"‘A wide place to cross,’ Paul said, and his voice was muffled by the filter trap across his face. "
26.0,89,text_content,Jessica glanced left and right – nothing but sand below. 
26.0,90,text_content,"four kilometers across,’ he said. "
26.0,91,text_content,"‘Worms,’ she said. "
26.0,92,text_content,‘Sure to be.’ 
26.0,93,text_content,"She focused on her weariness, the muscle ache that dulled her senses. ‘Shall we rest and eat?’ "
26.0,94,text_content,"to the rock beside him. She felt Paul turn as she settled herself, heard him scrabbling in the pack. "
26.0,95,text_content,"‘Here,’ he said. "
26.0,96,text_content,His hand felt dry against hers as he pressed two energy capsules into her palm. 
26.0,97,text_content,She swallowed them with a grudging spit of water from her stillsuit tube. 
26.0,98,text_content,You’re stronger. Trust your stillsuit.’ 
26.0,99,text_content,than a house full of sacrifice and strife.’ 
26.0,100,text_content,Jessica repeated the words to Paul. 
26.0,101,text_content,"‘That was Gurney,’ he said. "
26.0,102,text_content,"She caught the tone of his voice, the way he spoke as of someone dead, thought: ‘And well poor Gurney might be dead.’ The Atreides forces were either dead or captive or lost like themelves in this waterless void. "
26.0,103,text_content,"into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers.”’ "
26.0,104,text_content,"Jessica closed her eyes, found herself moved close to tears by the pathos in her son’s voice. "
26.0,105,text_content,"Presently, Paul said: ‘How do you … feel?’ "
26.0,106,text_content,feel … physically adequate.’ 
26.0,107,text_content,"of her formality: ‘I’m afraid of my son; I fear his strangeness; I fear what he may see ahead of us, what he may tell me.’ "
26.0,108,text_content,"own silence. His nose itched. He rubbed it, removed the filter and grew conscious of the rich smell of cinnamon. "
26.0,109,text_content,"‘There’s melange spice nearby,’ he said. "
26.0,110,text_content,he could sense the difference. 
26.0,111,text_content,"‘Dawn soon,’ he said. "
26.0,112,text_content,Jessica nodded. 
26.0,113,text_content,"‘There’s a way to get safely across that open sand,’ Paul said. ‘The Fremen do it.’ "
26.0,114,text_content,‘The worms?’ 
26.0,115,text_content,"‘If we were to plant a thumper from our Fremkit back in the rocks here,’ Paul said. ‘It’d keep a worm occupied for a time.’ "
26.0,116,text_content,She glanced at the stretch of moonlighted desert between them and the other escarpment. ‘Four kilometers’ worth of time?’ 
26.0,117,text_content,"‘Perhaps. And if we crossed there making only ‘natural’ sounds, the kind that don’t attract the worms …’ "
26.0,118,text_content,… if … if … 
26.0,119,text_content,He shook his head. 
26.0,120,text_content,"‘It’d have to be sounds without rhythm,’Jessica said. "
26.0,121,text_content,"We should be fully rested before we try it, though.’ "
26.0,122,text_content,the hour.’ 
26.0,123,text_content,‘Where’ll we spend the day?’ she asked. 
26.0,124,text_content,"face. There’ll be crevasses there, deep ones.’ "
26.0,125,text_content,‘Had we better get started?’ she asked. 
26.0,126,text_content,floor before we camp.’ 
26.0,127,text_content,‘Enough.’ She nodded for him to lead the way. 
26.0,128,text_content,"He hesitated, then lifted the pack, settled it onto his shoulders and turned along the cliff. "
26.0,129,text_content,they attract the worms the way a shield does.’ 
26.0,130,text_content,along the vestibule. 
26.0,131,text_content,to some ten meters’ width at the brink of a dim gray sandslope that slanted downward into darkness. 
26.0,132,text_content,‘Can we go down?’Jessica whispered. 
26.0,133,text_content,‘I think so.’ 
26.0,134,text_content,He tested the surface with one foot. 
26.0,135,text_content,"‘We can slide down,’ he said. ‘I’ll go first. Wait until you hear me stop.’ "
26.0,136,text_content,"‘Careful,’ she said. "
26.0,137,text_content,was deep within the rock walls. 
26.0,138,text_content,the cascade. It trailed away to silence. 
26.0,139,text_content,‘Mother?’ he said. 
26.0,140,text_content,There was no answer. 
26.0,141,text_content,‘Mother?’ 
26.0,142,text_content,"‘Mother, where are you?’ "
26.0,143,text_content,"Another cascade of sand swept down on him, burying him to the hips. He wrenched himself out of it. "
26.0,144,text_content,"‘She’s been caught in the sandslide,’ he thought. ‘Buried in it. I must be calm and work this out carefully. She won’t smother immediately. She’ll’ ‘compose herself in bindu suspension to reduce her oxygen needs. She knows I’ll dig for her.’ "
26.0,145,text_content,moving with an interior stateliness that contrasted with the fractional second of real time required for the total recall. 
26.0,146,text_content,"followed it, found an arm. Gently, he traced the arm, exposed her face. "
26.0,147,text_content,‘Do you hear me?’ he whispered. 
26.0,148,text_content,No answer. 
26.0,149,text_content,"He dug faster, freed her shoulders. She was limp beneath his hands, but he detected a slow heartbeat. "
26.0,150,text_content,"‘Bindu suspension,’ he told himself. "
26.0,151,text_content,a staggering run as the entire sandslope came down with a loud hiss that echoed and was magnified within the rock walls. 
26.0,152,text_content,"he lowered her to the sand, uttered the word to bring her out of the catalepsis. "
26.0,153,text_content,"She awakened slowly, taking deeper and deeper breaths. "
26.0,154,text_content,"‘I knew you’d find me,’ she whispered. "
26.0,155,text_content,He looked back up the fissure. ‘It might have been kinder if I hadn’t.’ 
26.0,156,text_content,‘Paul!’ 
26.0,157,text_content,"‘I lost the pack,’ he said. ‘It’s buried under a hundred tons of sand … at least.’ "
26.0,158,text_content,‘Everything?’ 
26.0,159,text_content,at the waist sash. ‘Knife and binoculars. We can get a good look around the place where we’ll die.’ 
26.0,160,text_content,sand out on the open desert. A chorus of birds held forth their songs from hidden places among the rocks. 
26.0,161,text_content,taught?’ 
26.0,162,text_content,‘Don’t you understand?’ he asked. ‘Everything we need to survive in this place is under that sand.’ 
26.0,163,text_content,"‘You found me,’ she said, and now her voice was soft, reasonable. "
26.0,164,text_content,Paul squatted back on his heels. 
26.0,165,text_content,"Presently, he looked up the fissure at the new slope, studying it, marking the looseness of the sand. "
26.0,166,text_content,"down a shaft to the pack. Water might do it, but we don’t have enough water for …’ He broke off, then: ‘Foam.’ "
26.0,167,text_content,Jessica held herself to stillness lest she disturb the hyperfunctioning of his mind. 
26.0,168,text_content,his attention on a darkened patch of sand below them. 
26.0,169,text_content,"‘Spice,’ he said. ‘Its essence – highly alkaline. And I have the paracompass. Its power pack is acid-base.’ "
26.0,170,text_content,Jessica sat up straight against the rock. 
26.0,171,text_content,to the desert’s floor. 
26.0,172,text_content,"She watched the way he walked, breaking his stride – step … pause, step-step … slide … pause … "
26.0,173,text_content,There was no rhythm to it that might tell a marauding worm something not of the desert moved here. 
26.0,174,text_content,"next, leaving an empty dished compartment in the instrument. "
26.0,175,text_content,"‘You’ll need water,’Jessica said. "
26.0,176,text_content,"Paul took the catchtube from his neck, sucked up a mouthful, expelled it into the dished compartment. "
26.0,177,text_content,"‘If this fails, that’s water wasted,’ Jessica thought. ‘But it won’t matter then, anyway.’ "
26.0,178,text_content,"With his knife, Paul cut open the power pack, spilled its crystals into the water. They foamed slightly, subsided. "
26.0,179,text_content,staring down at the open water. 
26.0,180,text_content,‘Great Mother!’ she thought. ‘They can sense water even at that distance!’

26.0,182,text_content,"Presently, he stopped, pressed a pinch of the spice into the paracompass, shook the instrument case. "
26.0,183,text_content,"kicking away the sand beneath it, immobilizing the opened face with more foam. "
26.0,184,text_content,"Jessica moved to a position below him, called out: ‘May I help?’ "
26.0,185,text_content,billowing from the instrument. 
26.0,186,text_content,"‘Quickly,’ Paul said. ‘No telling how long this foam will hold the sand.’ "
26.0,187,text_content,boiled from it. 
26.0,188,text_content,"As Paul directed the foam barrier, Jessica dug with her hands, hurling the sand down the slope. ‘How deep?’ she panted. "
26.0,189,text_content,slipping in loose sand. ‘Slant your digging backward. Don’t go straight down.’ 
26.0,190,text_content,Jessica obeyed. 
26.0,191,text_content,"Slowly, the hole went down, reaching a level even with the floor of the basin and still no sign of the pack. "
26.0,192,text_content,‘Could I have miscalculated?’ Paul asked himself. ‘I’m the one that panicked originally and caused this mistake. Has that warped my ability?’ 
26.0,193,text_content,He looked at the paracompass. Less than two ounces of the acid infusion remained. 
26.0,194,text_content,"Jessica straightened in the hole, rubbed a foam-stained hand across her cheek. Her eyes met Paul’s. "
26.0,195,text_content,"something hard. Slowly, she worked out a length of strap with a plastic buckle. "
26.0,196,text_content,"‘Don’t move any more of it,’ Paul said and his voice was almost a whisper. ‘We’re out of foam.’ "
26.0,197,text_content,"Jessica held the strap in one hand, looked up at him. "
26.0,198,text_content,you out and pull up the pack.’ 
26.0,199,text_content,"‘I understand,’ she said. "
26.0,200,text_content,‘Ready?’ 
26.0,201,text_content,‘Ready.’ She tensed her fingers on the strap. 
26.0,202,text_content,on a fold of Paul’s robe. Her shoulder ached from the strain put on it. 
26.0,203,text_content,"‘I still have the strap,’ she said. "
26.0,204,text_content,break it.’ 
26.0,205,text_content,the sand. Together then they pulled the pack downslope and out of its trap. 
26.0,206,text_content,In a few minutes they stood on the floor of the fissure holding the pack between them. 
26.0,207,text_content,"though she had been a target for balls of wet, green sand. "
26.0,208,text_content,"‘You look a mess,’ he said. "
26.0,209,text_content,"‘You’re not so pretty yourself,’ she said. "
26.0,210,text_content,"They started to laugh, then sobered. "
26.0,211,text_content,"‘That shouldn’t have happened,’ Paul said. ‘I was careless.’ "
26.0,212,text_content,"She shrugged, feeling caked sand fall away from her robe. "
26.0,213,text_content,"‘I’ll put up the tent,’ he said. ‘Better slip off that robe and shake it out.’ He turned away, taking the pack. "
26.0,214,text_content,"Jessica nodded, suddenly too tired to answer. "
26.0,215,text_content,"‘There’re anchor holes in the rock,’ Paul said. ‘Someone’s tented here before.’ "
26.0,216,text_content,away – far enough above the desert to avoid worms but close enough for easy access before a crossing. 
26.0,217,text_content,the other cliff lifting golden tan in morning light across open sand. 
26.0,218,text_content,"Jessica watched as he studied that apocalyptic landscape, his eyes probing into sand rivers and canyons. "
26.0,219,text_content,"‘There are growing things over there,’ he said. "
26.0,220,text_content,"Jessica found the spare binoculars in the pack beside the tent, moved up beside Paul. "
26.0,221,text_content,"‘There,’ he said, holding the binoculars with one hand and pointing with the other. "
26.0,222,text_content,She looked where he pointed. 
26.0,223,text_content,"‘Saguaro,’ she said. ‘Scrawny stuff.’ "
26.0,224,text_content,"‘There may be people nearby,’ Paul said. "
26.0,225,text_content,"‘That could be the remains of a botanical testing station,’ she warned. "
26.0,226,text_content,he said. 
26.0,227,text_content,‘Are we certain the Fremen will be friendly?’ she asked. 
26.0,228,text_content,‘Kynes promised their help.’ 
26.0,229,text_content,"‘But there’s desperation in the people of this desert,’ she thought. ‘I felt some of it myself today. Desperate people might kill us for our water.’ "
26.0,230,text_content,loads on suspensor-buoyed shoulder poles. And in the sea reaches there’d been the white petals of trimaran dhows. 
26.0,231,text_content,All of it gone. 
26.0,232,text_content,set the air aquiver out on the open sand. The other rock face across from them was like a thing seen through cheap glass. 
26.0,233,text_content,"It grew louder, a sound that once heard, was never forgotten. "
26.0,234,text_content,"‘Worm,’ Paul whispered. "
26.0,235,text_content,off to the left. 
26.0,236,text_content,"The sound diminished, died. "
26.0,237,text_content,"‘I’ve seen space frigates that were smaller,’ Paul whispered. "
26.0,238,text_content,"bitterly endless before them, beckoning beneath its horizontal collapse of skyline. "
26.0,239,text_content,"‘When we’ve rested,’ Jessica said, ‘we should continue with your lessons.’ "
26.0,240,text_content,"He suppressed a sudden anger, said: ‘Mother, don’t you think we could do without …’ "
26.0,241,text_content,"tendons, and tip sensitivity.’ She turned away. ‘Come, into the tent, now.’ "
26.0,242,text_content,her from this determination … that he must agree. 
26.0,243,text_content,"‘Whatever has been done to me, I’ve been a party to it,’ he thought. "
26.0,244,text_content,Review of the hand! 
26.0,245,text_content,He looked at his hand. How inadequate it appeared when measured against such creatures as that worm.

27.0,15,text_content,"‘Ah-h-h, the Bene Gesserit witch … perhaps. But Hawat is now a Harkonnen captive.’ "

27.0,17,text_content,"‘We will do nothing to attract attention to us,’ Tuek said. "
27.0,18,text_content,Halleck stiffened. ‘But—’

27.0,26,text_content,‘Hawat made few mistakes.’ 
27.0,27,text_content,‘He allowed himself to fall into Harkonnen hands.’ 
27.0,28,text_content,‘You think ‘he’s’ the traitor?’ 
27.0,29,text_content,Tuek shrugged. ‘This is academic. We think the witch is dead. At least the Harkonnens believe it.’ 
27.0,30,text_content,‘You seem to know a great deal about the Harkonnens.’ 
27.0,31,text_content,‘Hints and suggestions … rumors and hunches.’

27.0,36,text_content,‘So the witch is dead then … all dead.’ 
27.0,37,text_content,"Tuek nodded. ‘And Beast Rabban, so they say, will sit once more in the seat of power here on Dune.’ "

27.0,45,text_content,"‘In your mood, I’m not sure we want you to stay.’ "

27.0,57,text_content,‘Do you wish my blade beside you?’ Halleck asked. 
27.0,58,text_content,"Tuek sat back, relaxed, studying Halleck silently. "
27.0,59,text_content,‘Do you think of me ‘as fighting man?’’ Halleck pressed. 
27.0,60,text_content,… You defeated him the way we defeat Arrakis.’ 
27.0,61,text_content,‘Eh?’ 
27.0,62,text_content,"‘We live on sufferance down here, Gurney Halleck,’ Tuek said. Arrakis is our enemy.’ "

27.0,74,text_content,‘What do you mean?’ 
27.0,75,text_content,‘Haven’t you heard that there may’ve been Sardaukar with the Harkonnens?’ 
27.0,76,text_content,‘More rumors.’

27.0,78,text_content,sanctuary and a chance to draw the blood we both want. Be sure of that. The Fremen will offer you only the life of the hunted.’ 
27.0,79,text_content,"Halleck hesitated, sensing wisdom and sympathy in Tuek’s words, yet troubled for no reason he could explain. "
27.0,80,text_content,"‘Trust your own abilities,’ Tuek said. ‘Whose decisions brought your force through the battle? Yours. Decide.’ "
27.0,81,text_content,"‘It must be,’ Halleck said. ‘The Duke and his son are dead?’ "

27.0,94,text_content,‘Indeed.’

28.0,21,text_content,"‘We could be lost forever in this hellplace,’ she thought. And no one to know. "
28.0,22,text_content,"The night wind spread sand runnels that grated across her face, bringing the smell of cinnamon: a shower of odors in the dark. "

28.0,36,text_content,"He stepped out onto the windward face of the dune, following the curve of it, moved with a dragging pace. "
28.0,37,text_content,wait … drag … step … 
28.0,38,text_content,Time stretched out around them. The rock face ahead seemed to grow no nearer. The one behind still towered high. 
28.0,39,text_content,‘Lump! Lump! Lump! Lump!’ 
28.0,40,text_content,It was a drumming from the cliff behind. 
28.0,41,text_content,"‘The thumper,’ Paul hissed. "
28.0,42,text_content,Its pounding continued and they found difficulty avoiding the rhythm of it in their stride. 
28.0,43,text_content,‘Lump … lump … lump … lump …’ 
28.0,44,text_content,… Across pea sand that rolled under their feet: drag … wait … step …

28.0,49,text_content,"‘Keep moving,’ Paul whispered. ‘Don’t look back.’ "
28.0,50,text_content,A grating sound of fury exploded from the rock shadows they had left. It was a flailing avalanche of noise. 
28.0,51,text_content,"‘Keep moving,’ Paul repeated. "
28.0,52,text_content,He saw that they had reached an unmarked point where the two rock faces – the one ahead and the one behind – appeared equally remote. 
28.0,53,text_content,"And still behind them, that whipping, frenzied tearing of rocks dominated the night. "
28.0,54,text_content,saw that the beckoning escarpment ahead of them had climbed higher.

28.0,60,text_content,more from muscles that already were being taxed to their limits – the unnatural movement … 
28.0,61,text_content,"He stepped onto it, stumbled in his fatigue, righted himself with an involuntary outthrusting of a foot. "
28.0,62,text_content,Resonant booming shook the sand around them. 
28.0,63,text_content,Paul lurched sideways two steps. 
28.0,64,text_content,‘Boom! Boom!’ 
28.0,65,text_content,‘Drum sand!’Jessica hissed. 
28.0,66,text_content,away. 
28.0,67,text_content,"Behind them, he heard a hissing – like the wind, like a riptide where there was no water. "
28.0,68,text_content,"‘Run!’Jessica screamed. ‘Paul, run!’ "
28.0,69,text_content,They ran. 
28.0,70,text_content,gravel dragged at their feet. And the hissing approach of the worm was storm sound that grew around them. 
28.0,71,text_content,Jessica stumbled to her knees. All she could think of was the fatigue and the sound and the terror. 
28.0,72,text_content,Paul dragged her up. 
28.0,73,text_content,"They ran on, hand in hand. "
28.0,74,text_content,"A thin pole jutted from the sand ahead of them. They passed it, saw another. "
28.0,75,text_content,Jessica’s mind failed to register on the poles until they were past. 
28.0,76,text_content,There was another – wind-etched surface thrust up from a crack in rock.

28.0,87,text_content,Jessica crouched staring.

28.0,94,text_content,The smell of it flooded across him. 
28.0,95,text_content,"‘What has the worm to do with the spice, melange?’ he asked himself. And he remembered Liet-Kynes betraying a veiled reference to some association between worm and spice. "
28.0,96,text_content,‘Barrrroooom!’ 
28.0,97,text_content,It was like a peal of dry thunder coming from far off to their right. 
28.0,98,text_content,Again: ‘Barrrroooom!’ 
28.0,99,text_content,"The worm drew back onto the sand, lay there momentarily, its crystal teeth weaving moonflashes. "
28.0,100,text_content,‘Lump! Lump! Lump! Lump!’ 
28.0,101,text_content,‘Another thumper!’ Paul thought.

28.0,106,text_content,"Paul stepped out of the crack, watched the sand wave recede across the waste toward the new thumper summons. "
28.0,107,text_content,"Jessica followed, listening: ‘Lump … lump … lump … lump … lump …’ "
28.0,108,text_content,Presently the sound stopped. 
28.0,109,text_content,"Paul found the tube into his stillsuit, sipped at the reclaimed water. "
28.0,110,text_content,whispered. 
28.0,111,text_content,"‘Somebody called it,’ Paul said. ‘Fremen.’ "
28.0,112,text_content,She felt herself recovering. ‘It was so big!’ 
28.0,113,text_content,‘Not as big as the one that got our ’thopter.’ 
28.0,114,text_content,‘Are you sure it was Fremen?’ 
28.0,115,text_content,‘They used a thumper.’ 
28.0,116,text_content,‘Why would they help us?’ 
28.0,117,text_content,‘Maybe they weren’t helping us. Maybe they were just calling a worm.’

28.0,124,text_content,"Jessica waited a moment, resting, restoring her strength; then she followed. "

28.0,130,text_content,Another step. 
28.0,131,text_content,"‘It goes on up to the top, I think,’ he whispered. "

28.0,133,text_content,moonlit basin. 
28.0,134,text_content,"Paul stepped out into the rim of the basin, whispered: ‘What a beautiful place.’ "
28.0,135,text_content,Jessica could only stare in silent agreement from her position a step behind him. 
28.0,136,text_content,"the aching desire for rest, this basin’s beauty filled her senses, forcing her to stop and admire it. "

28.0,139,text_content,"Spreading away in front of her stretched desert growth – bushes, cacti, tiny clumps of leaves – all trembling in the moonlight. The ringwalls were dark to her left, moonfrosted on her right. "

28.0,28,text_content,"He began to feel cool, but that corner of logic in his mind told him: ‘The sun is overhead. You have no stillsuit and you’re hot; the sun is burning the moisture out of your body.’ "
28.0,29,text_content,His fingers clawed feebly at the sand. 
28.0,30,text_content,‘They couldn’t even leave me a stillsuit!’

28.0,64,text_content,The bird took another hop closer to Kynes’ outstretched hand. Two more hawks drifted down to the sand behind it.

28.0,75,text_content,‘They’ve come!’ Kynes thought. ‘My Fremen have found me!’ 
28.0,76,text_content,Then he heard the sand rumbling. 
28.0,77,text_content,a dust whirlpool at its center. It would exchange what had been formed deep in the sand for whatever lay on the surface. 
28.0,78,text_content,The hawks circled overhead screeching their frustration. They knew what was happening. Any desert creature would know.

29.0,23,text_content,"‘A likely cub,’ the man said. ‘If you’re fugitives from the Harkonnens, it may be you’re welcome among us. What is it, boy?’ "
29.0,24,text_content,The possibilities flashed through Paul’s mind: ‘A trick? A fact?’ Immediate decision was needed. 
29.0,25,text_content,‘Why should you welcome fugitives?’ he demanded. 
29.0,26,text_content,"who does not pay the fai, the water tribute, to the Harkonnens. That is why I might welcome a fugitive.’ "
29.0,27,text_content,"‘He knows who we are,’ Paul thought. ‘There’s concealment in his voice.’ "
29.0,28,text_content,"‘I am Stilgar, the Fremen,’ the tall man said. ‘Does that speed your tongue, boy?’ "
29.0,29,text_content,"‘It is the same voice,’ Paul thought. And he remembered the Council with this man seeking the body of a friend slain by the Harkonnens. "
29.0,30,text_content,"with you my father’s man, Duncan Idaho – an exchange of friends.’ "
29.0,31,text_content,"‘And Idaho abandoned us to return to his Duke,’ Stilgar said. "
29.0,32,text_content,"Jessica heard the shading of disgust in his voice, held herself prepared for attack. "
29.0,33,text_content,"The voice from the rocks above them called: ‘We waste time here, Stil.’ "
29.0,34,text_content,"‘This is the Duke’s son,’ Stilgar barked. ‘He’s certainly the one Liet told us to seek.’ "
29.0,35,text_content,"‘But … a child, Stil.’ "

29.0,37,text_content,And Jessica heard him excluding her from his thoughts. Had he already passed sentence? 
29.0,38,text_content,"‘We haven’t time for the test,’ the voice above them protested. "
29.0,39,text_content,"‘Yet he could be the Lisan al-Gaib,’ Stilgar said. "
29.0,40,text_content,‘He’s looking for an omen!’ Jessica thought. 
29.0,41,text_content,"‘But the woman,’ the voice above them said. "
29.0,42,text_content,Jessica readied herself anew. There had been death in that voice. 
29.0,43,text_content,"‘Yes, the woman,’ Stilgar said. ‘And her water.’ "
29.0,44,text_content,"‘You know the law,’ said the voice from the rocks. ‘One who cannot live with the desert—’ "

29.0,46,text_content,‘Did Liet ‘command’ this?’ asked the voice from the rocks. 
29.0,47,text_content,"‘You heard the voice of the cielago, Jamis,’ Stilgar said. ‘Why do you press me?’ "
29.0,48,text_content,"And Jessica thought: ‘Cielago!’ The clue of the tongue opened wide avenues of understanding: this was the language of Ilm and Fiqh, and cielago meant ‘bat,’ a small flying mammal. ‘Voice of the cielago:’ they had received a distrans message to seek Paul and herself. "

29.0,57,text_content,"‘The strength of a woman can be boundless,’ Stilgar said. ‘Certain it is in a Reverend Mother. Are you a Reverend Mother?’ "
29.0,58,text_content,"For the moment, Jessica put aside the implications of the question, answered truthfully, ‘No.’ "
29.0,59,text_content,‘Are you trained in the ways of the desert?’ 
29.0,60,text_content,"‘No, but many consider my training valuable.’ "
29.0,61,text_content,"‘We make our own judgments on value,’ Stilgar said. "

29.0,72,text_content,"A voice out of the basin said: ‘The boy got away, Stil. What are we—’ "
29.0,73,text_content,"‘Of course he got away, you sand-brained … Ugh-h-h! Easy, woman!’ "

29.0,91,text_content,There was a stirring in the basin as Stilgar’s words sank home. 
29.0,92,text_content,‘And if I agree to teach you the … weirding way?’ 
29.0,93,text_content,‘My countenance for you as well as your son.’ 
29.0,94,text_content,‘How can we be sure of the truth in your promise?’ 
29.0,95,text_content,you wish. Your water shall mingle with our water.’ 
29.0,96,text_content,‘Can you speak for all Fremen?’Jessica asked. 
29.0,97,text_content,speak of you to any other sietch. The Harkonnens have returned to Dune in force and your Duke is dead. It is said that you two died in a Mother storm. The hunter does not seek dead game.’ 
29.0,98,text_content,"‘There’s safety in that,’ Jessica thought. ‘But these people have good communications and a message could be sent.’ "
29.0,99,text_content,"‘I presume there was a reward offered for us,’ she said. "

29.0,102,text_content,"‘Then I shall teach you my way of battle,’Jessica said, and she sensed the unconscious ritual-intensity of her own words. "
29.0,103,text_content,"‘Now, you will release me?’ "
29.0,104,text_content,"‘So be it,’Jessica said. She released her hold on him, stepped aside in full view of the band in the basin. ‘This is the test-mashad,’ she thought. ‘But Paul must know about them even if I die for his knowledge.’ "

29.0,106,text_content,"Stilgar’s voice came up from the basin: ‘You, up there! Stop hunting the boy. He’ll come down presently.’ "
29.0,107,text_content,"The voice of a young boy or girl sounded from the darkness above Paul: ‘But, Stil, he can’t be far from—’ "
29.0,108,text_content,"‘I said leave him be, Chani! You spawn of a lizard!’ "
29.0,109,text_content,There came a whispered imprecation from above Paul and a low voice: ‘Call ‘me’ spawn of a lizard!’ But the shadow pulled back out of view. 
29.0,110,text_content,"Paul returned his attention to the basin, picking out the gray-shadowed movement of Stilgar beside his mother. "
29.0,111,text_content,"‘Come in, all of you,’ Stilgar called. He turned to Jessica. ‘And now I’ll ask you how ‘we’ may be certain you’ll fulfill your half of our bargain? You’re the one’s lived with papers and empty contracts and such as—’ "
29.0,112,text_content,"‘We of the Bene Gesserit don’t break our vows any more than you do,’Jessica said. "
29.0,113,text_content,"There was a protracted silence, then a multiple hissing of voices: ‘A Bene Gesserit witch!’ "

29.0,123,text_content,Stilgar shifted uneasily. ‘We must go now.’

29.0,132,text_content,"‘Paul, you may come down now,’Jessica said. "

29.0,152,text_content,"He moved out through his band now, inspecting them, giving Paul’s Fremkit pack to one of his men to carry. "
29.0,153,text_content,"‘Bakka,’ Jessica thought, recognizing the religious term: ‘bakka – the weeper.’ She sensed how the symbolism of the kerchiefs united this band. ‘Why should weeping unite them?’ she asked herself. "

29.0,155,text_content,"Chani touched Paul’s arm. ‘Come along, child-man.’ "
29.0,156,text_content,"Paul hid the anger in his voice, said: ‘My name is Paul. It were well you—’ "

30.0,6,text_content,"‘The men who climbed above us, where are they going?’ Paul whispered. "

30.0,9,text_content,"‘Faster,’ Chani whispered. "

31.0,35,text_content,Stilgar glanced at Jessica. ‘Is this true? Is there water in your pack?’ 
31.0,36,text_content,‘Yes.’ 
31.0,37,text_content,‘Literjons of it?’ 
31.0,38,text_content,‘Two literjons.’ 
31.0,39,text_content,‘What was intended with this wealth?’ 
31.0,40,text_content,"‘Wealth?’ she thought. She shook her head, feeling the coldness in his voice. "
31.0,41,text_content,way.’ 
31.0,42,text_content,A sighing gasp arose from the people around them: ‘Water fell from the sky … it ran ‘over’ the land.’ 
31.0,43,text_content,reach Tabr this night?’ 
31.0,44,text_content,"‘How could I know?’ Jessica shook her head. ‘If they’re in need, give them water from our pack.’ "
31.0,45,text_content,‘Is that what you intended with this wealth?’ 
31.0,46,text_content,"‘I intended it to save life,’ she said. "
31.0,47,text_content,"‘Then we accept your blessing, Sayyadina.’ "
31.0,48,text_content,me call you out before I’ve proved my words.’ 
31.0,49,text_content,"Stilgar faced Jamis. ‘Are you determined to press this fight against a child, Jamis?’ His voice was low, venomous. "
31.0,50,text_content,‘She must be championed.’ 
31.0,51,text_content,‘Even though she has my countenance?’ 
31.0,52,text_content,"‘I invoke the amtal rule,’Jamis said. ‘It’s my right.’ "
31.0,53,text_content,back the blade as I’ve done before.’ 
31.0,54,text_content,"‘You cannot do this thing,’Jessica said. ‘Paul’s just—’ "
31.0,55,text_content,you cannot best us all united. This must be; it is the amtal rule.’ 
31.0,56,text_content,"his expression. She shifted her attention to Jamis, saw the brooding look to his brows and thought: ‘I should’ve seen that before. He broods. He’s the silent kind, one who works himself up inside. I should’ve been prepared.’ "
31.0,57,text_content,"‘If you harm my son,’ she said, ‘You’ll have me to meet. I call you out now. I’ll carve you into a joint of—’ "
31.0,58,text_content,"‘Mother.’ Paul stepped forward, touched her sleeve. ‘Perhaps if I explain to Jamis how—’ "
31.0,59,text_content,‘Explain!’Jamis sneered. 
31.0,60,text_content,visions of himself dead under a knife. There had been so few avenues of escape for him in that vision … 
31.0,61,text_content,"Stilgar said: ‘Sayyadina, you must step back now where—’ "
31.0,62,text_content,us knows it.’ 
31.0,63,text_content,"‘He has talked enough,’ Jessica thought. ‘I’ve the key to him. I could immobilize him with a word.’ She hesitated. ‘But I cannot stop them all.’ "
31.0,64,text_content,at the end. 
31.0,65,text_content,"Jamis stared at her, fright visible on his face. "
31.0,66,text_content,entire—’ 
31.0,67,text_content,‘She tries a spell on me!’Jamis gasped. He put his clenched right fist beside his ear. ‘I invoke the silence on her!’ 
31.0,68,text_content,and you’ll be forfeit.’ He nodded for her to step back. 
31.0,69,text_content,"the throng, the elfin-faced Chani whispering in his ear as she nodded toward Jamis. "
31.0,70,text_content,A ring formed within the troop. More glowglobes were brought and all of them tuned to the yellow band. 
31.0,71,text_content,"crowd. He stood waiting, clad in loincloth and some tight fabric over his feet, a crysknife in his right hand. "
31.0,72,text_content,their own lifetimes. The boy knew the devious ways of the Bene Gesserit and he looked supple and confident. 
31.0,73,text_content,"‘But he’s only fifteen,’ she thought. ‘And he has no shield. I must stop this. Somehow, there must be a way to …’ She looked up, saw Stilgar watching her. "
31.0,74,text_content,"‘You cannot stop it,’ he said. ‘You must not speak.’ "
31.0,75,text_content,"She put a hand over her mouth, thinking: ‘I’ve planted fear in Jamis’ mind. It’ll slow him some … perhaps. If I could only pray – truly pray.’ "
31.0,76,text_content,blink in which to slash you. And he can fight either hand; look out for a knife shift.’’

31.0,78,text_content,also stab; the shearing-guard can also trap your opponent’s blade.’’ 
31.0,79,text_content,‘could be’ broken. 
31.0,80,text_content,Jamis began sidling to the right along the edge of the ring opposite Paul. 
31.0,81,text_content,"speed, he knew that shield-awareness was part of him. "
31.0,82,text_content,Jamis called out in ritual challenge: ‘May thy knife chip and shatter!’ 
31.0,83,text_content,"‘This knife will break then,’ Paul thought. "
31.0,84,text_content,"He cautioned himself that Jamis also was without shield, but the man wasn’t trained to its use, had no shield-fighter inhibitions. "
31.0,85,text_content,milky yellow in the light of the glowglobes. 
31.0,86,text_content,"that guided them, but this was the ‘real-now.’ This was death hanging on an infinite number of minuscule mischances. "
31.0,87,text_content,"a glowglobe’s brilliance, a deceptive shadow. "
31.0,88,text_content,"‘I’m afraid,’ Paul told himself. "
31.0,89,text_content,"And he circled warily opposite Jamis, repeating to himself the Bene Gesserit litany against fear. ‘‘Fear is the mind-killer’ …’It was a cool bath washing over him. He felt muscles unite themselves, become poised and ready. "
31.0,90,text_content,"‘I’ll sheathe my knife in your blood,’Jamis snarled. And in the middle of the last word, he pounced. "
31.0,91,text_content,"Jessica saw the motion, stifled an outcry. "
31.0,92,text_content,Where the man struck there was only empty air and Paul stood now behind Jamis with a clear shot at the exposed back. 
31.0,93,text_content,"‘Now, Paul! Now!Jessica’ screamed it in her mind. "
31.0,94,text_content,to the right. 
31.0,95,text_content,"Paul withdrew, crouching low. ‘First, you must find my blood,’ he said. "
31.0,96,text_content,It needed control and trickery to get through a shield. 
31.0,97,text_content,‘Does Paul see it?’ she asked herself. ‘He must!’ 
31.0,98,text_content,"Again Jamis attacked, ink-dark eyes glaring, his body a yellow blur under the glowglobes. "
31.0,99,text_content,And again Paul slipped away to return too slowly on the attack. 
31.0,100,text_content,And again. 
31.0,101,text_content,And again. 
31.0,102,text_content,"Each time, Paul’s counterblow came an instant late. "
31.0,103,text_content,time at the precisely correct angle they would take if a shield were helping deflect part of Jamis’ blow. 
31.0,104,text_content,remain silent.’ 
31.0,105,text_content,crouched with knife held low. 
31.0,106,text_content,"Again, Jamis pounced, and this time he twisted to the right where Paul had been dodging. "
31.0,107,text_content,away to the left and thankful for Chani’s warning. 
31.0,108,text_content,eyes were wide and staring – two blue-black holes – studying Paul with a new wariness in the dull light of the glowglobes. 
31.0,109,text_content,"‘Ah, that one hurt,’ Stilgar murmured. "
31.0,110,text_content,"Paul crouched at the ready and, as he had been trained to do after first blood, called out: ‘Do you yield?’ "
31.0,111,text_content,‘Hah!’Jamis cried. 
31.0,112,text_content,An angry murmur arose from the troop. 
31.0,113,text_content,Death is the test of it.’ 
31.0,114,text_content,Jessica saw Paul swallow hard. And she thought: ‘He’s never killed a man like this … in the hot blood of a knife fight. Can he do it?’ 
31.0,115,text_content,any clear channel ahead to show itself. 
31.0,116,text_content,"flood, creating maelstroms in the current around it. "
31.0,117,text_content,"‘Have an end to it, lad,’ Stilgar muttered. ‘Don’t play with him.’ "
31.0,118,text_content,"Paul crept farther into the ring, relying on his own edge in speed. "
31.0,119,text_content,a Fremen crysknife. 
31.0,120,text_content,and trained to it from infancy. Now the fear I planted in him has come to bloom.’ 
31.0,121,text_content,And she found in herself a sense of pity for Jamis – an emotion tempered by awareness of the immediate peril to her son. 
31.0,122,text_content,"And for the first time she sensed, without understanding it, the uncertainty factor in Paul’s gift. "
31.0,123,text_content,and use them.’’ 
31.0,124,text_content,The crowd in the cavern began to mutter. 
31.0,125,text_content,"‘They think Paul’s toying with Jamis,’ Jessica thought. ‘They think Paul’s being needlessly cruel.’ "
31.0,126,text_content,to Paul. 
31.0,127,text_content,to his left hand. 
31.0,128,text_content,Jessica gasped. 
31.0,129,text_content,"But Paul had been warned by Chani: ‘‘Jamis fights with either hand.’’ And the depth of his training had taken in that trick ‘en passant. ‘Keep the mind on the knife and not on the hand that holds it,’’ Gurney Halleck had told him time and again. ‘‘The knife is more dangerous than the hand and the knife can be in either hand.’’ "
31.0,130,text_content,had been intended to confuse Paul and hide the knife shift. 
31.0,131,text_content,chest was descending – then away to watch the man crumple. 
31.0,132,text_content,dead eyes stared out like beads of dark glass. 
31.0,133,text_content,"‘‘Killing with the point lacks artistry,’’ Idaho had once told Paul, ‘‘but don’t let that hold your hand when the opening presents itself.’’ "
31.0,134,text_content,a group of them hurried back into the depths of the cavern carrying a burden wrapped in a robe. 
31.0,135,text_content,And there was no body on the rock floor. 
31.0,136,text_content,"Jessica pressed through toward her son. She felt that she swam in a sea of robed and stinking backs, a throng strangely silent. "
31.0,137,text_content,"‘Now is the terrible moment,’ she thought. ‘He has killed a man in clear superiority of mind and muscle. He must not grow to enjoy such a victory.’ "
31.0,138,text_content,his stillsuit. 
31.0,139,text_content,helping them. 
31.0,140,text_content,"‘Him against Jamis and not a mark on him,’ one of the men muttered. "
31.0,141,text_content,"Chani stood at one side, her eyes focused on Paul. Jessica saw the girl’s excitement, the admiration in the elfin face. "
31.0,142,text_content,"‘It must be done now and swiftly,’ Jessica thought. "
31.0,143,text_content,"She compressed ultimate scorn into her voice and manner, said: ‘We-l-l, now – how does it feel to be a killer?’ "
31.0,144,text_content,he glanced toward the place on the cavern floor where Jamis had lain. 
31.0,145,text_content,"you to call me out and try for my burda, do not think you will play with me the way you played with Jamis.’ "
31.0,146,text_content,"and fear … and in some – loathing. She looked at Stilgar, saw his fatalism, knew how the fight had seemed to him. "
31.0,147,text_content,"Paul looked at his mother. ‘You know what it was,’ he said. "
31.0,148,text_content,killed a man with a naked blade.’ 
31.0,149,text_content,"Stilgar faced her, disbelief in his face. "
31.0,150,text_content,of Jamis’ blood on the cavern floor. ‘I did not want to kill him.’ 
31.0,151,text_content,heard muttering awareness spread through the troop. 
31.0,152,text_content,"we’d admitted a scorpion into our midst.’ He hesitated, then: ‘And I shall not call you lad the more.’ "
31.0,153,text_content,"A voice from the troop called out: ‘Needs a naming, Stil.’ "
31.0,154,text_content,"may use it, but none other may so presume … Usul.’ "
31.0,155,text_content,she was included in it with her champion. She was indeed Sayyadina. 
31.0,156,text_content,"‘Now, what name of manhood ‘do you’ choose for us to call you openly?’ Stilgar asked. "
31.0,157,text_content,"Paul glanced at his mother, back to Stilgar. Bits and pieces of this moment registered on his prescient ‘memory,’ but he felt the differences as though they were physical, a pressure forcing him through the narrow door of the present. "
31.0,158,text_content,"‘How do you call among you the little mouse, the mouse that jumps?’ Paul asked, remembering the ‘pop-hop’ of motion at Tuono Basin. He illustrated with one hand. "
31.0,159,text_content,A chuckle sounded through the troop. 
31.0,160,text_content,"‘We call that one muad’dib,’ Stilgar said. "
31.0,161,text_content,sudden fear ‘of her’ son ‘and for’ him. 
31.0,162,text_content,but all around him was abyss. 
31.0,163,text_content,burning across the universe in the name of their prophet Muad’Dib. 
31.0,164,text_content,"‘That must not happen,’ he told himself. "
31.0,165,text_content,"‘Is that the name you wish, Muad’Dib?’ Stilgar asked. "
31.0,166,text_content,I be known among you as Paul-Muad’Dib?’ 
31.0,167,text_content,"‘You are Paul-Muad’Dib,’ Stilgar said. "
31.0,168,text_content,And Paul thought: ‘That was in no vision of mine. I did a different thing.’ 
31.0,169,text_content,But he felt that the abyss remained all around him. 
31.0,170,text_content,legend for sure … Lisan al-Gaib … Lisan al-Gaib …’ 
31.0,171,text_content,"over the land. Muad’Dib we call “instructor-of-boys.” That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul-Muad’Dib, who is Usul among us. We welcome you.’ "
31.0,172,text_content,"Stilgar touched Paul’s forehead with one palm, withdrew his hand, embraced Paul and murmured, ‘Usul.’ "
31.0,173,text_content,some of them by name. And there was Chani who pressed her cheek against his as she held him and said his name. 
31.0,174,text_content,Paul-Muad’Dib’s nose plugs are as poor a fit as I’ve ever seen! I thought I ordered you to see after him!’ 
31.0,175,text_content,"‘I hadn’t the makings, Stil,’ she said. ‘There’s Jamis’, of course, but—’ "
31.0,176,text_content,‘Enough of that!’ 
31.0,177,text_content,"‘Then I’ll share one of mine,’ she said. ‘I can make do with one until—’ "
31.0,178,text_content,savages?’ 
31.0,179,text_content,Usul and the Sayyadina.’ 
31.0,180,text_content,"A voice lifted from the back of the troop: ‘What of the water, Stil? What of the literjons in their pack?’ "
31.0,181,text_content,"‘I know your need, Farok,’ Stilgar said. He glanced at Jessica. She nodded. "
31.0,182,text_content,sietch at field rates less pack fees.’ 
31.0,183,text_content,‘What is this repayment at field rates?’Jessica asked. 
31.0,184,text_content,"‘Ten for one,’ Stilgar said. "
31.0,185,text_content,‘But—’ 
31.0,186,text_content,"‘It’s a wise rule as you’ll come to see,’ Stilgar said. "
31.0,187,text_content,A rustling of robes marked movement at the back of the troop as men turned to get the water.

32.0,5,text_content,How they had scurried to tighten their stillsuits when the cave was opened! 
32.0,6,text_content,"Deep within the cave, someone began chanting: "
32.0,7,text_poem,‘Ima trava okolo!

32.0,9,text_content,Jessica translated silently: ‘‘These are ashes!And these are roots!’’

32.0,18,text_content,"weighed on her mind. ‘No,’ she corrected herself: ‘it was preoccupation with’ moisture. "
32.0,19,text_content,And that was a more subtle and profound matter. 
32.0,20,text_content,"She heard approaching footsteps, turned to see Paul come out of the cave’s depths trailed by the elfin-faced Chani. "
32.0,21,text_content,not as wife.’ 
32.0,22,text_content,"Then she wondered at herself, thinking: ‘Have I been infected with his schemes?’ And she saw how well she had been conditioned. ‘I can think of the marital needs of royalty without once weighing my own concubinage. Yet … I was more than concubine.’ "
32.0,23,text_content,‘Mother.’ 
32.0,24,text_content,Paul stopped in front of her. Chani stood at his elbow. 
32.0,25,text_content,"‘Mother, do you know what they’re doing back there?’ "
32.0,26,text_content,Jessica looked at the dark patch of his eyes staring out from the hood. ‘I think so.’ 
32.0,27,text_content,‘Chani showed me … because I’m supposed to see it and give my … permission for the weighing of the water.’ 
32.0,28,text_content,Jessica looked at Chani. 
32.0,29,text_content,"flesh belongs to the person, but his water belongs to the tribe … except in the combat.’ "
32.0,30,text_content,"‘They say the water’s mine,’ Paul said. "

32.0,33,text_content,did not want the water distilled out of Jamis’ flesh. 
32.0,34,text_content,"‘It’s … water,’ Chani said. "
32.0,35,text_content,"Jessica marveled at the way she said it. ‘‘Water.’’ So much meaning in a simple sound. A Bene Gesserit axiom came to Jessica’s mind: ‘‘Survival is the ability to swim in strange water.’’ And Jessica thought: ‘Paul and I, we must find the currents and patterns in these strange waters … if we’re to survive.’ "
32.0,36,text_content,"‘You will accept the water,’Jessica said. "
32.0,37,text_content,a large sum offered for his support in a questionable venture – because money maintained power for the Atreides. 
32.0,38,text_content,"On Arrakis, water was money. She saw that clearly. "
32.0,39,text_content,had forced him to re-evaluate. To refuse the water would be to break with accepted Fremen practice. 
32.0,40,text_content,Presently Paul recalled the words of 467 Kalima in Yueh’s O.C. Bible. He said: ‘From water does all life begin.’ 
32.0,41,text_content,Jessica stared at him. ‘Where did he learn that quotation?’ she asked herself. ‘He hasn’t studied the mysteries.’ 
32.0,42,text_content,created.’ 
32.0,43,text_content,time to see the sunset. A violent calamity of color spilled over the sky as the sun dipped beneath the horizon. 
32.0,44,text_content,‘It is time!’ 
32.0,45,text_content,voice lowered. ‘Thus it is with Jamis.’ 
32.0,46,text_content,Silence fell like a blanket on the cavern. 
32.0,47,text_content,the coolness. 
32.0,48,text_content,"‘The friends of Jamis will approach,’ Stilgar said. "
32.0,49,text_content,Its yellow glow picked out an inflowing of human figures. Jessica heard the rustling of the robes. 
32.0,50,text_content,Chani took a step away as though pulled by the light. 
32.0,51,text_content,to placate the shade of Jamis.’ 
32.0,52,text_content,and render it motionless. 
32.0,53,text_content,"Chani glided back to Jessica’s side, took her hand. ‘Come, Sayyadina. We must sit apart.’ "
32.0,54,text_content,"Paul watched them move off into the shadows, leaving him alone. He felt abandoned. "
32.0,55,text_content,The men who had fixed the curtain came up beside him. 
32.0,56,text_content,"‘Come, Usul.’ "
32.0,57,text_content,"the glowglobe and beside a bundled, curving, and angular shape gathered beneath a robe on the rock floor. "

32.0,60,text_content,"‘Jamis,’ the troop responded. "

32.0,66,text_content,"Again, Stilgar bent over the mound. "
32.0,67,text_content,"‘For Jamis’ woman and for the guards,’ he said. The small rocks and the book were taken into the folds of his robe. "
32.0,68,text_content,"‘Leader’s right,’ the troop intoned. "
32.0,69,text_content,Usul in suitable ceremony when we return to the sietch.’ 
32.0,70,text_content,"‘Leader’s right,’ the troop intoned. "
32.0,71,text_content,"Lastly, he took the crysknife handle and stood with it. ‘For the funeral plain,’ he said. "
32.0,72,text_content,"‘For the funeral plain,’ the troop responded. "
32.0,73,text_content,"our dead.’ She looked across at Paul, wondering: ‘Will he see it? Will he know what to do?’ "
32.0,74,text_content,"‘We are friends of Jamis,’ Stilgar said. ‘We are not wailing for our dead like a pack of garvarg.’ "
32.0,75,text_content,"‘When our water went below minim at the siege of Two Birds, Jamis shared.’ The man returned to his place in the circle. "
32.0,76,text_content,"‘Am I supposed to say I was a friend of Jamis?’ Paul wondered. ‘Do they expect me to take something from that pile?’ He saw faces turn toward him, turn away. ‘They expect it!’ "
32.0,77,text_content,to his place in the circle. 
32.0,78,text_content,hissed: ‘Would you bring the destruction on us?’ 
32.0,79,text_content,‘How can I say I was his friend?’ Paul wondered. 
32.0,80,text_content,"needs of truth, that spirit withdrew and spared my son.’ She returned to her place. "
32.0,81,text_content,And Paul recalled the scorn in his mother’s voice as she had confronted him after the fight. ‘‘How does it feel to be a killer?’’ 
32.0,82,text_content,for him on ‘The Cult of the Dead’ flickered through Paul’s mind. He knew what he had to do. 
32.0,83,text_content,"Slowly, Paul got to his feet. "
32.0,84,text_content,A sigh passed around the circle. 
32.0,85,text_content,"the mound of belongings, lifted out the baliset. A string twanged softly as it struck against something in the pile. "
32.0,86,text_content,"‘I was a friend of Jamis,’ Paul whispered. "

32.0,88,text_content,"Blindly, he groped his way back to his place in the circle, sank to the rock floor. "
32.0,89,text_content,A voice hissed: ‘He sheds tears!’ 
32.0,90,text_content,It was taken up around the ring: ‘Usul gives moisture to the dead!’ 
32.0,91,text_content,"He felt fingers touch his damp cheek, heard the awed whispers. "
32.0,92,text_content,tears. She focused on the words: ‘‘He gives moisture to the dead.’’ It was a gift to the shadow world – tears. They would be sacred beyond a doubt. 
32.0,93,text_content,– it was life itself and entwined all around with symbolism and ritual.

32.0,96,text_content,his palm. Then he saw the faces beyond the groping hands – the eyes wide and wondering. 
32.0,97,text_content,as the troop honored him by a respectful isolation. 
32.0,98,text_content,The ceremony ended with a low chant: 
32.0,99,text_poem,‘Full moon calls thee –

32.0,112,text_content,"‘Bi-lal kaifa,’ intoned the troop. "
32.0,113,text_content,"‘I must accept that water,’ Paul thought. Slowly, he arose, made his way to Chani’s side. Stilgar stepped back to make room for him, took the baliset gently from his hand. "
32.0,114,text_content,"‘Kneel,’ Chani said. "
32.0,115,text_content,Paul knelt.

32.0,120,text_content,‘Do you accept them?’ Stilgar asked. 
32.0,121,text_content,"Paul swallowed, nodded. ‘Yes.’ "
32.0,122,text_content,She extended her hand. 
32.0,123,text_content,‘Will you … hold them for me?’ Paul asked.

32.0,133,text_content,It was like a child’s game that had lost all inhibition in adult hands. 
32.0,134,text_content,he passed it. 
32.0,135,text_content,"Paul turned a questioning stare on Chani, tugged her arm. ‘That air felt damp,’ he said. "
32.0,136,text_content,"‘Sh-h-h-h,’ she whispered. "

32.0,141,text_content,"he felt steps beneath his feet, curving down to the left. Light reflected back up across hooded heads and a winding movement of people spiraling down the steps. "
32.0,142,text_content,"Jessica sensed mounting tension in the people around her, a pressure of silence that rasped her nerves with its urgency. "

32.0,157,text_content,"‘A treasure trove,’ she said. "
32.0,158,text_content,of us know them all.’ He cocked his head to one side. The globe cast a yellow-shadowed glow across face and beard. ‘Hear that?’ 
32.0,159,text_content,They listened. 
32.0,160,text_content,was caught up in a rapture of listening. Only Paul seemed to stand remote from it. 
32.0,161,text_content,"He sensed a need for decision, but felt powerless to move. "
32.0,162,text_content,"we have it, we shall change the face of Arrakis.’ "
32.0,163,text_content,A hushed whisper of response lifted from the troop: ‘Bi-lal kaifa.’ 
32.0,164,text_content,"‘We will trap the dunes beneath grass plantings,’ Stilgar said, his voice growing stonger. ‘We will tie the water into the soil with trees and undergrowth.’ "
32.0,165,text_content,"‘Bi-lal kaifa,’ intoned the troop. "
32.0,166,text_content,"‘Each year the polar ice retreats,’ Stilgar said. "

32.0,173,text_content,would be easy to imbue with fervor and fanaticism. They could be wielded like a sword to win back Paul’s place for him. 
32.0,174,text_content,"‘We leave now,’ Stilgar said, ‘and wait for the first moon’s rising. When Jamis is safely on his way, we will go home.’ "
32.0,175,text_content,"Whispering their reluctance, the troop fell in behind him, turned back along the water barrier and up the stairs. "

32.0,179,text_content,There was a melancholy in his tone that she did not like. 
32.0,180,text_content,"Chani’s voice intruded from the deep cave darkness: ‘Tell me about the waters of your birthworld, Paul-Muad’Dib.’ "
32.0,181,text_content,"And Paul: ‘Another time, Chani. I promise.’ "
32.0,182,text_content,‘Such sadness.’ 
32.0,183,text_content,"‘It’s a good baliset,’ Chani said. "
32.0,184,text_content,"‘Very good,’ Paul said. ‘Do you think Jamis’ll mind my using it?’ "
32.0,185,text_content,"‘He speaks of the dead in the present tense,’ Jessica thought. The implications disturbed her. "
32.0,186,text_content,"A man’s voice intruded: ‘He liked music betimes, Jamis did.’ "
32.0,187,text_content,"‘Then sing me one of your songs,’ Chani pleaded. "
32.0,188,text_content,"‘Such feminine allure in that girl-child’s voice,’ Jessica thought. ‘I must caution Paul about their women … and soon.’ "
32.0,189,text_content,"‘This was a song of a friend of mine,’ Paul said. ‘I expect he’s dead now, Gurney is. He called it his evensong.’ "

32.0,204,text_content,And Jessica heard the after-stillness that hummed in the air with the last note. ‘Why does my son sing a love song to that girl-child?’ she asked herself. She felt an abrupt fear. She could sense life flowing around her and she had no grasp on its reins. ‘Why did he choose that song?’ she wondered. ‘The instincts are true sometimes.

33.0,17,text_content,"‘I told my nephew of the great esteem our Emperor holds for you, Count Fenring,’ the Baron said. And he thought: ‘Mark him well, Feyd! A killer with the manners of a rabbit – this is the most dangerous kind.’ "

33.0,20,text_content,"‘I … ah, congratulate you on the hm-m-m perfection of your ah-h-h heir. In the light of the hm-m-m elder, one might say.’ "
33.0,21,text_content,"‘You are too kind,’ the Baron said. He bowed, but Feyd-Rautha noted that his uncle’s eyes did not agree with the courtesy. "
33.0,22,text_content,"‘When you’re mm-m-m ironic, that ah-h-h suggests you’re hm-m-m-m thinking deep thoughts,’ the Count said. "
33.0,23,text_content,"‘There he goes again,’ Feyd-Rautha thought. ‘It sounds like he’s being insulting, but there’s nothing you can call out for satisfaction.’ "
33.0,24,text_content,Listening to the man gave Feyd-Rautha the feeling his head was being pushed through mush … ‘um-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m-m!’ Feyd-Rautha turned his attention back to the Lady Fenring. 
33.0,25,text_content,"‘We’re ah-h-h taking up too much of this young man’s time,’ she said. ‘I understand he’s to appear in the arena today.’ "

33.0,29,text_content,But the Count only smiled and said: ‘Hm-m-m-m-um-m-m.’

33.0,34,text_content,And the Lady Fenring thought: ‘Can that be the young man the Reverend Mother meant! Is’ that ‘a bloodline we must preserve?’ 
33.0,35,text_content,He tipped his gross head to the right. ‘There’s a considerable amount of progress to be discussed.’

33.0,50,text_content,"‘Ah, yes … unfortunate, that.’ "
33.0,51,text_content,"‘We’ve word from an overflight across the southern reaches,’ the Count said. ‘There’s evidence of plant life.’ "
33.0,52,text_content,‘Has the Guild then agreed to a watch from space?’ 
33.0,53,text_content,"‘You know better than that, Baron. The Emperor cannot legally post a watch on Arrakis.’ "
33.0,54,text_content,"‘And ‘I’ cannot afford it,’ the Baron said. ‘Who made this overflight?’ "
33.0,55,text_content,‘A … smuggler.’

33.0,57,text_content,"‘We’ll discuss various types of static another time,’ the Count said. "
33.0,58,text_content,"‘Ah-h-h-h,’ the Baron thought. ‘Have you found some mistake in my accounting then?’ he demanded. "

33.0,61,text_content,There was a storm.’ 
33.0,62,text_content,"‘Yes, there were so many convenient accidents,’ the Count agreed. "
33.0,63,text_content,"‘I do not like your tone, Count,’ the Baron said. "
33.0,64,text_content,the Great Houses all would learn what you did on Arrakis. They’ve long suspected how you do business.’ 
33.0,65,text_content,"‘The only recent business I can recall,’ the Baron said, ‘was transportation of several legions of Sardaukar to Arrakis.’ "
33.0,66,text_content,‘You think you could hold that over the Emperor’s head?’ 
33.0,67,text_content,‘I wouldn’t think of it!’ 
33.0,68,text_content,with your Fremen scum.’ 
33.0,69,text_content,"‘Many might doubt such a confession,’ the Baron said, but the threat staggered him. ‘Are Sardaukar truly that disciplined?’ he wondered. "
33.0,70,text_content,"‘The Emperor does wish to audit your books,’ the Count said. "

33.0,77,text_content,‘Does he think to frighten me by reminding me that he is supported by bloodthirsty killers?’ the Baron wondered. 
33.0,78,text_content,must be left to work the spice.’ 
33.0,79,text_content,"The Count emitted a short, barking laugh. ‘You think you can harness the Fremen?’ "
33.0,80,text_content,Emperor deserves credit for the inspiration.’ 
33.0,81,text_content,‘Ah-h-h?’ 
33.0,82,text_content,"‘You see, Count, I have the Emperor’s prison planet, Salusa Secundus, to inspire me.’ "
33.0,83,text_content,The Count stared at him with glittering intensity. ‘What possible connection is there between Arrakis and Salusa Secundus?’ 
33.0,84,text_content,"The Baron felt the alertness in Fenring’s eyes, said: ‘No connection yet.’ "
33.0,85,text_content,‘Yet?’ 
33.0,86,text_content,‘You must admit it’d be a way to develop a substantial work force on Arrakis – use the place as a prison planet.’ 
33.0,87,text_content,‘You anticipate an increase in prisoners?’ 
33.0,88,text_content,I paid that damnable Guild to transport our mutual force to Arrakis. That money has to come from ‘somewhere.’’ 
33.0,89,text_content,"‘I suggest you not use Arrakis as a prison planet without the Emperor’s permission, Baron.’ "
33.0,90,text_content,"‘Of course not,’ the Baron said, and he wondered at the sudden chill in Fenring’s voice. "
33.0,91,text_content,"‘Another matter,’ the Count said. ‘We learn that Duke Leto’s Mentat, Thufir Hawat, is not dead but in your employ.’ "
33.0,92,text_content,"‘I could not bring myself to waste him,’ the Baron said. "
33.0,93,text_content,‘You lied to our Sardaukar commander when you said Hawat was dead.’ 
33.0,94,text_content,"‘Only a white lie, my dear Count. I hadn’t the stomach for a long argument with the man.’ "
33.0,95,text_content,‘Was Hawat the real traitor?’ 
33.0,96,text_content,was without a Mentat. You know that. I’ve never been without a Mentat. It was most unsettling.’ 
33.0,97,text_content,‘How could you get Hawat to shift allegiance?’ 
33.0,98,text_content,– he’d die in a few days.’ 
33.0,99,text_content,"‘Withdraw the antidote,’ the Count said. "
33.0,100,text_content,‘But he’s useful!’ 
33.0,101,text_content,‘And he knows too many things no living man should know.’ 
33.0,102,text_content,‘You said the Emperor doesn’t fear exposure.’ 
33.0,103,text_content,"‘Don’t play games with me, Baron!’ "
33.0,104,text_content,"‘When I see such an order above the Imperial seal I’ll obey it,’ the Baron said. ‘But I’ll not submit to your whim.’ "
33.0,105,text_content,‘You think it whim?’ 
33.0,106,text_content,"‘What else can it be? The Emperor has obligations to me, too, Fenring. I rid him of the troublesome Duke.’ "
33.0,107,text_content,‘With the help of a few Sardaukar.’ 
33.0,108,text_content,‘Where else would the Emperor have found a House to provide the disguising uniforms to hide his hand in this matter?’ 
33.0,109,text_content,"‘He has asked himself the same question, Baron, but with a slightly different emphasis.’ "
33.0,110,text_content,the Emperor doesn’t believe he can move against ‘me’ in total secrecy.’ 
33.0,111,text_content,‘He hopes it won’t become necessary.’ 
33.0,112,text_content,"‘The Emperor cannot believe I threaten him!’ The Baron permitted anger and grief to edge his voice, thinking: ‘Let him wrong me in that! I could place myself on the throne while still beating my breast over how I’d been wronged.’ "
33.0,113,text_content,The Count’s voice went dry and remote as he said: ‘The Emperor believes what his senses tell him.’

33.0,132,text_content,The Baron hid his sudden stiffening of surprise by stumbling on the first step down from the exit. ‘Proces verbal! That was a report of a crime against the Imperium!’

33.0,138,text_content,"There’s nothing like the arena to expose the true person from beneath the mask, eh?’ "

33.0,141,text_content,"‘White for poison, black for purity,’ the Lady Fenring said. ‘A curious custom, isn’t it, my love?’ "
33.0,142,text_content,"‘Um-m-m-m,’ the Count said. "

33.0,155,text_content,"Again, silence settled over the arena. "
33.0,156,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha turned, faced the big red door across from him through which the gladiator would emerge. "
33.0,157,text_content,The special gladiator. 
33.0,158,text_content,to the slavemaster. 
33.0,159,text_content,A low humming arose from the red door’s servo-motors as they were armed for opening. 
33.0,160,text_content,counter and feint. 
33.0,161,text_content,The red door slammed open. 
33.0,162,text_content,and the group at the pru-door. 
33.0,163,text_content,"‘I like not the look of this one,’ said one of Feyd-Rautha’s barb-men. ‘Are you sure he’s drugged, m’Lord?’ "
33.0,164,text_content,"‘He has the color,’ Feyd-Rautha said. "
33.0,165,text_content,"‘Yet he stands like a fighter,’ said another helper. "
33.0,166,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha advanced two steps onto the sand, studied this slave. "
33.0,167,text_content,‘What has he done to his arm?’ asked one of the distractors. 
33.0,168,text_content,to a design drawn in blood on the left hip of the green leotards – a wet shape there; the formalized outline of a hawk. 
33.0,169,text_content,Hawk! 
33.0,170,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha looked up into the darkly pitted eyes, saw them glaring at him with uncommon alertness. "

33.0,176,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha felt his own excitement kindle. ‘Let there be treachery in Hawat’s mind,’ he thought. ‘I can handle this slave. And it’s’ ‘my long knife that carries the poison this time, not the short one. Even Hawat doesn’t know that.’ "
33.0,177,text_content,"‘Hai, Harkonnen!’ the slave called. ‘Are you prepared to die?’ "
33.0,178,text_content,Deathly stillness gripped the arena. ‘Slaves did not issue the challenge!’ 
33.0,179,text_content,"man stood, loose and ready, muscles prepared for victory. The slave grapevine had carried Hawat’s message to this one: ‘‘You’ll get a true chance to kill the na-Baron.’’ That much of the scheme was as they’d planned it, then. "
33.0,180,text_content,"A tight smile crossed Feyd-Rautha’s mouth. He lifted the barbs, seeing success for his plans in the way the gladiator stood. "
33.0,181,text_content,"‘Hai! Hai!’ the slave challenged, and crept forward two steps. "
33.0,182,text_content,"‘No one in the galleries can mistake it now,’ Feyd-Rautha thought. "
33.0,183,text_content,not terror. 
33.0,184,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha lifted the barbs high, nodded in an almost-greeting. "
33.0,185,text_content,The gladiator pounced. 
33.0,186,text_content,from severing the tendons of the na-Baron’s left leg. 
33.0,187,text_content,man could not withdraw them without ripping tendons. 
33.0,188,text_content,A concerted gasp lifted from the galleries. 
33.0,189,text_content,The sound filled Feyd-Rautha with elation. 
33.0,190,text_content,would interpret the events in the arena only one way – threat to himself.

33.0,192,text_content,out to ask if he needed them. 
33.0,193,text_content,He waved them back to the pru-door.

33.0,195,text_content,"panting, smelled his own sweat and a faint odor of blood on the air. "
33.0,196,text_content,"appeared to stumble, heard the scream from the galleries. "
33.0,197,text_content,"Again, the slave pounced. "
33.0,198,text_content,muscle of the slave’s right arm. 
33.0,199,text_content,Shrill cheers rained from the galleries. 
33.0,200,text_content,that way before. And he thought with an edge of grimness on a thing Hawat had told him: ‘‘It’s easier to be terrified by an enemy you admire.’’ 
33.0,201,text_content,waited for the advancing slave. 
33.0,202,text_content,"The man took only the time to lash the second barb tight to his arm, then sped in pursuit. "
33.0,203,text_content,"‘Let the family see me do this thing,’ Feyd-Rautha thought. ‘I am their enemy: let them think of me as they see me now.’ "
33.0,204,text_content,He drew his short blade. 
33.0,205,text_content,before a handler lays finger to my flesh. And I’ll have you dead beside me!’ 
33.0,206,text_content,blade in his other hand. 
33.0,207,text_content,gloved hand that tradition said should carry the poison. 
33.0,208,text_content,"‘You will die, Harkonnen,’ the gladiator gasped. "
33.0,209,text_content,The air around them filled with ozone from the fields. 
33.0,210,text_content,‘Die on your own poison!’ the slave grated. 
33.0,211,text_content,"He began forcing the white-gloved hand inward, turning the blade he thought carried the poison. "
33.0,212,text_content,arm. 
33.0,213,text_content,focused on the fact that a man could also die on an unpoisoned blade. 
33.0,214,text_content,‘Scum!’ Feyd-Rautha gasped. 
33.0,215,text_content,"between them sufficient for the long blade. Its poisoned tip flicked out, drew a red line down the slave’s chest. There was instant agony in the poison. The man disengaged himself, staggered backward. "

33.0,217,text_content,been done to him and he knew how it had been done. The wrong blade had carried the poison.

33.0,220,text_content,"universe. He still clutched his knife, but its point wavered. "
33.0,221,text_content,"‘One day … one … of us … will … get … you,’ he gasped. "
33.0,222,text_content,"A sad little moue contorted his mouth. He sat, sagged, then stiffened and rolled away from Feyd-Rautha, face down. "
33.0,223,text_content,his own knife protruding from his breast. 
33.0,224,text_content,the paralysis to do this thing to himself. With the admiration came the realization that here was ‘truly’ a thing to fear. 
33.0,225,text_content,‘That which makes a man superhuman is terrifying.’ 
33.0,226,text_content,him. They were cheering with utter abandon. 
33.0,227,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha turned, looking up at them. "
33.0,228,text_content,"whom were staring down at him, their faces masked by smiles. "
33.0,229,text_content,"Count Fenring turned to his lady, said: ‘Ah-h-h-um-m-m, a resourceful um-m-m-m young man. Eh, mm-m-m-ah, my dear?’ "
33.0,230,text_content,"‘His ah-h-h synaptic responses are very swift,’ she said. "
33.0,231,text_content,"The Baron looked at her, at the Count, returned his attention to the arena: ‘If someone could get that close to one of mine! Rage’ began to replace his fear. ‘I’ll have the slavemaster dead over a slow fire this night … and if this Count and his lady had a hand in it…’ "
33.0,232,text_content,came now from all around: 
33.0,233,text_content,‘Head! Head! Head! Head!’ 
33.0,234,text_content,his hand toward the young man standing in the arena beside the sprawled body of the slave. ‘Give the boy a head. He earned it by exposing the slavemaster.’ 
33.0,235,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha saw the signal of agreement, thought: ‘They think they honor me. Let them see what I think!’ "
33.0,236,text_content,it in the limp hands. 
33.0,237,text_content,he said. ‘The man earned it.’ 
33.0,238,text_content,as well as courage.’ 
33.0,239,text_content,"‘He insults the crowd by refusing the head,’ the Baron muttered. "
33.0,240,text_content,"‘Not at all,’ Lady Fenring said. She turned, looking up at the tiers around them. "
33.0,241,text_content,And the Baron noted the line of her neck – a truly lovely flowing of muscles – like a young boy’s. 
33.0,242,text_content,"‘They like what your nephew did,’ she said. "
33.0,243,text_content,"wild, beating on each other, screaming and stamping. "
33.0,244,text_content,"pennant over the box – once, twice, three times – signal for a fete. "
33.0,245,text_content,"undiminished frenzy of the crowd, he called: ‘A fete, Uncle?’ "
33.0,246,text_content,The noise began to subside as people saw the conversation and waited. 
33.0,247,text_content,"‘In your honor, Feyd!’ the Baron called down. And again, he caused the pennant to be dipped in signal. "
33.0,248,text_content,"Across the arena, the pru-barriers had been dropped and young men were leaping down into the arena, racing toward Feyd-Rautha. "
33.0,249,text_content,"‘You ordered the pru-shields dropped, Baron?’ the Count asked. "
33.0,250,text_content,"‘No one will harm the lad,’ the Baron said. ‘He’s a hero.’ "
33.0,251,text_content,"The first of the charging mass reached Feyd-Rautha, lifted him on their shoulders, began parading around the arena. "
33.0,252,text_content,last of their food and drink just for his company.’ 
33.0,253,text_content,that require my immediate attention. The guard will see you to the keep.’ 
33.0,254,text_content,"The Count arose, bowed. ‘Certainly, Baron. We’re looking forward to the fete. I’ve ah-h-h-mm-m-m never seen a Harkonnen fete.’ "
33.0,255,text_content,"‘Yes,’ the Baron said. ‘The fete.’ He turned, was enveloped by guards as he stepped into the private exit from the box. "
33.0,256,text_content,"A guard captain bowed to Count Fenring. ‘Your orders, my Lord?’ "
33.0,257,text_content,"‘We will ah-h-h wait for the worst mm-m-m crush to um-m-m pass,’ the Count said. "
33.0,258,text_content,"‘Yes, m’Lord.’ The man bowed himself back three paces. "
33.0,259,text_content,"Count Fenring faced his lady, spoke again in their personal humming-code tongue: ‘You saw it, of course?’ "
33.0,260,text_content,no surprise.’ 
33.0,261,text_content,"‘It was planned,’ he said. ‘The entire performance.’ "
33.0,262,text_content,‘Without a doubt.’ 
33.0,263,text_content,‘It stinks of Hawat.’ 
33.0,264,text_content,"‘Indeed,’ she said. "
33.0,265,text_content,‘I demanded earlier that the Baron eliminate Hawat.’ 
33.0,266,text_content,"‘That was an error, my dear.’ "
33.0,267,text_content,‘I see that now.’ 
33.0,268,text_content,‘The Harkonnens may have a new Baron ere long.’ 
33.0,269,text_content,‘If that’s Hawat’s plan.’ 
33.0,270,text_content,"‘That will bear examination, true,’ she said. "
33.0,271,text_content,‘The young one will be more amenable to control.’ 
33.0,272,text_content,"‘For us … after tonight,’ she said. "
33.0,273,text_content,"‘You don’t anticipate difficulty seducing him, my little brood-mother?’ "
33.0,274,text_content,"‘No, my love. You saw how he looked at me.’ "
33.0,275,text_content,"‘Yes, and I can see now why we must have that bloodline.’ "
33.0,276,text_content,to bend him.’ 
33.0,277,text_content,"‘We’ll leave as soon as possible – as soon as you’re sure,’ he said. "
33.0,278,text_content,She shuddered. ‘By all means. I should not want to bear a child in this terrible place.’ 
33.0,279,text_content,"‘The things we do in the name of humanity,’ he said. "
33.0,280,text_content,"‘Yours is the easy part,’ she said. "
33.0,281,text_content,"‘There ‘are’ some ancient prejudices I overcome,’ he said. ‘They’re quite primordial, you know.’ "
33.0,282,text_content,"‘My poor dear,’ she said, and patted his cheek. ‘You know this is the only way to be sure of saving that bloodline.’ "
33.0,283,text_content,He spoke in a dry voice: ‘I quite understand what we do.’ 
33.0,284,text_content,"‘We won’t fail,’ she said. "
33.0,285,text_content,"‘Guilt starts as a feeling of failure,’ he reminded. "
33.0,286,text_content,"‘There’ll be no guilt,’ she said. ‘Hypno-ligation of that Feyd-Rautha’s psyche and his child in my womb – then we go.’ "
33.0,287,text_content,"‘That uncle,’ he said. ‘Have you ever seen such distortion?’ "
33.0,288,text_content,"‘He’s pretty fierce,’ she said, ‘but the nephew could well grow to be worse.’ "
33.0,289,text_content,"code to guide him, for example.’ "
33.0,290,text_content,"‘It’s sad,’ she said. "
33.0,291,text_content,"lad, good union of breeding and training.’ He shook his head. ‘But we shouldn’t waste sorrow over the aristocracy of misfortune.’ "
33.0,292,text_content,"‘There’s a Bene Gesserit saying,’ she said. "

34.0,5,text_content,the fold of your hood down over your forehead! Leave only the eyes exposed. You waste moisture.’ 
34.0,6,text_content,A whispered command behind them demanded silence: ‘The desert hears you!’ 
34.0,7,text_content,A bird chirruped from the rocks high above them. 
34.0,8,text_content,"The troop stopped, and Paul sensed abrupt tension. "
34.0,9,text_content,"There came a faint thumping from the rocks, a sound no louder than mice jumping in the sand. "
34.0,10,text_content,"Again, the bird chirruped. "
34.0,11,text_content,"A stir passed through the troop’s ranks. And again, the mouse-thumping pecked its way across the sand. "
34.0,12,text_content,"Once more, the bird chirruped. "
34.0,13,text_content,"Paul with caution, and he noted covert glances toward Chani, the way she seemed to withdraw, pulling in upon herself. "
34.0,14,text_content,past two moisture-sealed doors and into a globe-lighted narrow passage with yellow rock walls and ceiling. 
34.0,15,text_content,"looked for Chani, found that she had left his side. He was hemmed in by a press of robed bodies. Someone jostled him, said, ‘Excuse me, Usul. What a crush! It’s always this way.’ "
34.0,16,text_content,"releasing the hood catch, elbowing a space around them. "
34.0,17,text_content,harmonics. 
34.0,18,text_content,"‘Why are we waiting, Farok?’ Paul asked. "
34.0,19,text_content,"‘For the Reverend Mother, I think. You heard the message – poor Chani.’ "
34.0,20,text_content,"‘Poor Chani?’ Paul asked himself. He looked around, wondering where she was, where his mother had got to in all this crush. "
34.0,21,text_content,"Farok took a deep breath. ‘The smells of home,’ he said. "
34.0,22,text_content,working with the spice … you make paper … plastics … and isn’t that chemical explosives?’ 
34.0,23,text_content,‘You know this from what you smell?’ It was another man’s voice. 
34.0,24,text_content,nostrils. 
34.0,25,text_content,and Paul heard hushed voices back down the line: ‘It’s true then – Liet is dead.’ 
34.0,26,text_content,"‘Liet,’ Paul thought. Then: ‘Chani, daughter of Liet.’ The pieces fell together in his mind. Liet was the Fremen name of the planetologist. "
34.0,27,text_content,"Paul looked at Farok, asked: ‘Is it the Liet known as Kynes?’ "
34.0,28,text_content,"‘There is only one Liet,’ Farok said. "
34.0,29,text_content,"Paul turned, stared at the robed back of a Fremen in front of him. ‘Then Liet-Kynes is dead,’ he thought. "
34.0,30,text_content,"‘It was Harkonnen treachery,’ someone hissed. ‘They made it seem an accident … lost in the desert … a ’thopter crash …’ "
34.0,31,text_content,sent his Fremen cohorts searching for two strays in the desert … another victim of the Harkonnens.

34.0,33,text_content,of her eyes. 
34.0,34,text_content,"She turned toward him, and Paul saw golden rings threaded with water tallies dangling from her ears. "
34.0,35,text_content,‘‘This’ bested my Jamis?’ she demanded. 
34.0,36,text_content,"‘Be silent, Harah,’ Stilgar said. ‘It was Jamis’ doing – ‘he’ invoked the tahaddi al-burhan.’ "
34.0,37,text_content,"‘My children made fatherless by another child? Surely, ‘twas an accident!’ "
34.0,38,text_content,"‘Usul, how many years have you?’ Stilgar asked. "
34.0,39,text_content,"‘Fifteen standard,’ Paul said. "
34.0,40,text_content,Stilgar swept his eyes over the troop. ‘Is there one among you cares to challenge me?’ 
34.0,41,text_content,Silence. 
34.0,42,text_content,"Stilgar looked at the woman. ‘Until I’ve learned his weirding ways, I’d not challenge him.’ "
34.0,43,text_content,She returned his stare. ‘But—’ 
34.0,44,text_content,to this lad. The mother and son are masters of the weirding ways of battle.’ 
34.0,45,text_content,"‘Lisan al-Gaib,’ the woman whispered. Her eyes held awe as she turned them back toward Paul. "
34.0,46,text_content,"‘The legend again,’ Paul thought. "
34.0,47,text_content,"is yours … and this, his woman.’ "
34.0,48,text_content,"Paul studied the woman, wondering: ‘Why isn’t she mourning her man? Why does she show no hate for me?’ Abruptly, he saw that the Fremen were staring at him, waiting. "
34.0,49,text_content,Someone whispered: ‘There’s work to do. Say how you accept her.’ 
34.0,50,text_content,Stilgar said: ‘Do you accept Harah as woman or servant?’ 
34.0,51,text_content,with Geoff … before Jamis bested him.’ 
34.0,52,text_content,"‘Jamis killed another to win her,’ Paul thought. "
34.0,53,text_content,"Paul said: ‘If I accept her as servant, may I yet change my mind at a later time?’ "
34.0,54,text_content,always share some responsibility for the sons of Jamis.’ 
34.0,55,text_content,"‘I accept her as servant,’ Paul said. "
34.0,56,text_content,"Harah stamped a foot, shook her shoulders with anger. ‘But I’m young!’ "
34.0,57,text_content,"Stilgar looked at Paul, said: ‘Caution’s a worthy trait in a man who’d lead.’ "
34.0,58,text_content,‘But I’m young!’ Harah repeated.

34.0,60,text_content,‘Oh-h-h-h!’ she said. 
34.0,61,text_content,"being delayed here. He wondered if he dared ask the whereabouts of his mother and Chani, saw from Stilgar’s nervous stance that it would be a mistake. "
34.0,62,text_content,will discuss your youth another time.’ 
34.0,63,text_content,"She backed away two steps, cast a frightened glance at Stilgar. ‘He has the weirding voice,’ she husked. "
34.0,64,text_content,"‘Stilgar,’ Paul said ‘Chani’s father put heavy obligation on me. If there’s anything …’ "
34.0,65,text_content,troop following him. 
34.0,66,text_content,our quarters.’ And he smoothed his voice with relaxants. 
34.0,67,text_content,‘You’ll not cast me out when the year’s gone?’ she said. ‘I know for true I’m not as young as once I was.’ 
34.0,68,text_content,"‘As long as I live you’ll have a place with me,’ he said. He released her arm. ‘Come now, where are our quarters?’ "
34.0,69,text_content,"globes. The stone floor was smooth, swept clean of sand. "
34.0,70,text_content,"Paul moved up beside her, studied the aquiline profile as they walked. ‘You do not hate me, Harah?’ "
34.0,71,text_content,‘Why should I hate you?’ 
34.0,72,text_content,behind the children partly hidden by filmy hangings. 
34.0,73,text_content,‘I … bested Jamis.’ 
34.0,74,text_content,to the dead. Is that truth?’ 
34.0,75,text_content,‘Yes.’ 
34.0,76,text_content,‘It’s more than I’ll do … can do.’ 
34.0,77,text_content,‘Don’t you mourn him?’

34.0,88,text_content,‘Likely.’ 
34.0,89,text_content,‘Yet we take the time to …’ He motioned with his head toward the arch now far behind them. ‘… make … dew collectors?’ 
34.0,90,text_content,‘The planting goes on.’ 
34.0,91,text_content,‘What’re dew collectors?’ he asked. 
34.0,92,text_content,The glance she turned on him was full of surprise. ‘Don’t they teach you anything in the … wherever it is you come from?’ 
34.0,93,text_content,‘Not about dew collectors.’ 
34.0,94,text_content,"‘Hai!’ she said, and there was a whole conversation in the one word. "
34.0,95,text_content,"‘Well, what are they?’ "

34.0,97,text_content,"‘Dew collectors,’ he muttered, enchanted by the simple beauty of such a scheme. "

34.0,102,text_content,She recoiled at the harsh edge in his voice.

34.0,137,text_content,"‘We’re alike in that,’ he thought. "

35.0,29,text_content,"The litter-carriers deposited their burden gently on the ledge from below, and Chani helped the old woman to her feet. "
35.0,30,text_content,"‘So this is their Reverend Mother,’ Jessica thought. "
35.0,31,text_content,for a long moment before speaking in a husky whisper. 
35.0,32,text_content,‘So you’re the one.’ The old head nodded precariously on the thin neck. ‘The Shadout Mapes was right to pity you.’ 
35.0,33,text_content,"Jessica spoke quickly, scornfully: ‘I need no one’s pity.’ "
35.0,34,text_content,"‘That remains to be seen,’ husked the old woman. She turned with surprising quickness and faced the throng. ‘Tell them, Stilgar.’ "
35.0,35,text_content,‘Must I?’ he asked.

35.0,37,text_content,"Stilgar took a deep breath, stepped forward two paces. "

35.0,39,text_content,"boomed out across the uplifted faces, reverberating with the force given it by the acoustical horn behind the ledge. "
35.0,40,text_content,Still the throng remained silent.

35.0,42,text_content,"Now, the throng stirred, rippling with whispers and currents of disquiet. "

35.0,45,text_content,"‘If I die in the attempt, what will become of him?’ Jessica asked herself. Again she felt the misgivings fill her mind. "
35.0,46,text_content,"Chani led the old Reverend Mother to a rock bench deep in the acoustical horn, returned to stand beside Stilgar. "

35.0,49,text_content,A susurrant response arose from the crowd: ‘She has seen the waters.’ 
35.0,50,text_content,"‘I consecrate the daughter of Liet in the Sayyadina,’ husked the old woman. "
35.0,51,text_content,"‘She is accepted,’ the crowd responded. "

35.0,59,text_content,"‘Let the watermasters come forward,’ Chani said with only the slightest quaver of uncertainty in her girl-child voice. "

35.0,61,text_content,"a small skin sack, perhaps twice the size of a human head. The sacks sloshed heavily. "
35.0,62,text_content,The two leaders deposited their load at Chani’s feet on the ledge and stepped back. 
35.0,63,text_content,of the neck. The black pits of their eyes stared back at her without wavering. 
35.0,64,text_content,"A furry redolence of cinnamon arose from the sack, wafted across Jessica. ‘The spice?’ she wondered. "
35.0,65,text_content,‘Is there water?’ Chani asked. 
35.0,66,text_content,"he said, ‘but we cannot drink of it.’ "
35.0,67,text_content,‘Is there seed?’ Chani asked. 
35.0,68,text_content,"‘There is seed,’ the man said. "
35.0,69,text_content,Chani knelt and put her hands to the sloshing sack. ‘Blessed is the water and its seed.’ 
35.0,70,text_content,and she sat hunched over as though asleep. 
35.0,71,text_content,"‘Sayyadina Jessica,’ Chani said. "
35.0,72,text_content,Jessica turned to see the girl staring up at her. 
35.0,73,text_content,‘Have you tasted the blessed water?’ Chani asked. 
35.0,74,text_content,unprivileged.’ 
35.0,75,text_content,"A sigh passed through the crowd, a susurration of robes that made the nape hairs creep on Jessica’s neck. "
35.0,76,text_content,the sloshing sack. 
35.0,77,text_content,the ritual and had eyes only for Chani. 
35.0,78,text_content,"‘Has he seen this moment in time?’ Jessica wondered. She rested a hand on her abdomen, thinking of the unborn daughter there, asking herself: ‘Do I have the right to risk us both?’ "
35.0,79,text_content,"that frees the soul. If you be a Reverend Mother, it opens the universe to you. Let Shai-hulud judge now.’ "
35.0,80,text_content,"and drink of the sack’s contents, but as she bent to the proffered spout, her senses told her its peril. "
35.0,81,text_content,"The stuff in the sack had a bitter smell subtly akin to many poisons that she knew, but unlike them, too. "
35.0,82,text_content,"‘You must drink it now,’ Chani said. "
35.0,83,text_content,"‘There’s no turning back,’ Jessica reminded herself. But nothing in all her Bene Gesserit training came into her mind to help her through this instant. "
35.0,84,text_content,‘What is it?’ Jessica asked herself. ‘Liquor? A drug?’ 
35.0,85,text_content,a faint bite acrid on the tongue. 
35.0,86,text_content,"she swallowed it, fighting to retain her calmness and dignity. "
35.0,87,text_content,"‘To accept a little death is worse than death itself,’ Chani said. She stared at Jessica, waiting. "
35.0,88,text_content,"of her mouth, in her cheeks, in her eyes – a biting sweetness, now. "
35.0,89,text_content,‘Cool.’ 
35.0,90,text_content,"Again, Chani sent the liquid gushing into Jessica’s mouth. "
35.0,91,text_content,‘Delicate.’ 
35.0,92,text_content,Jessica studied Chani’s face – elfin features – seeing the traces of Liet-Kynes there as yet unfixed by time. 
35.0,93,text_content,"‘This is a drug they feed me,’ Jessica told herself. "
35.0,94,text_content,"But it was unlike any other drug of her experience, and Bene Gesserit training included the taste of many drugs. "
35.0,95,text_content,"Chani’s features were so clear, as though outlined in light. "
35.0,96,text_content,‘A drug.’ 
35.0,97,text_content,"extension of herself. She was the mote, yet not the mote. "
35.0,98,text_content,"The cavern remained around her – the people. She sensed them: Paul, Chani, Stilgar, the Reverend Mother Ramallo. "
35.0,99,text_content,‘Reverend Mother!’ 
35.0,100,text_content,"At the school there had been rumors that some did not survive the Reverend Mother ordeal, that the drug took them. "
35.0,101,text_content,time – suspended time for her alone. 
35.0,102,text_content,"‘Why is time suspended?’ she asked herself. She stared at the frozen expressions around her, seeing a dust mote above Chani’s head, stopped there. "
35.0,103,text_content,Waiting. 
35.0,104,text_content,The answer to this instant came like an explosion in her consciousness: her personal time was suspended to save her life. 
35.0,105,text_content,"core, a pit of blackness from which she recoiled. "
35.0,106,text_content,"‘That is the place where we cannot look,’ she thought. ‘There is the place the Reverend Mothers are so reluctant to mention – the place where only a Kwisatz Haderach may look.’ "
35.0,107,text_content,becoming a mote-self that searched within her for danger. 
35.0,108,text_content,She found it within the drug she had swallowed. 
35.0,109,text_content,"entire chain of molecules confronted her, and she recognized a protein … a methyl-protein configuration. "
35.0,110,text_content,‘Ah-h-h!’ 
35.0,111,text_content,It was a soundless Mentat sigh within her as she saw the nature of the poison. 
35.0,112,text_content,a linkage of oxygen … hydrogen. 
35.0,113,text_content,The change spread … faster and faster as the catalyzed reaction opened its surface of contact. 
35.0,114,text_content,"– gently, collecting a drop of moisture. "
35.0,115,text_content,"‘Chani’s taking the catalyst from my body to change the poison in that sack,’ Jessica thought. ‘Why?’ "
35.0,116,text_content,ledge. A dry hand touched her neck. 
35.0,117,text_content,closer. 
35.0,118,text_content,They touched! 
35.0,119,text_content,"It was like an ultimate ‘simpatico,’ being two people at once: not telepathy, but mutual awareness. "
35.0,120,text_content,‘With the old Reverend Mother!’ 
35.0,121,text_content,young girl with a dancing spirit and tender humor. 
35.0,122,text_content,"Within the mutual awareness, the young girl said, ‘Yes, that is how I am.’ "
35.0,123,text_content,"Jessica could only accept the words, not respond to them. "
35.0,124,text_content,"‘You’ll have it all soon, Jessica,’ the inward image said. "
35.0,125,text_content,"‘This is hallucination,’ Jessica told herself. "
35.0,126,text_content,"a long pause, then: ‘You should’ve told us you were pregnant!’ "
35.0,127,text_content,Jessica found the voice that talked within the mutual awareness: ‘Why?’ 
35.0,128,text_content,"‘This changes both of you! Holy Mother, what have we done?’ "
35.0,129,text_content,"wildly here, there, circling. It radiated pure terror. "
35.0,130,text_content,soothe … use your courage and your strength … gently now … gently …’ 
35.0,131,text_content,"The other whirling mote swept near, and Jessica compelled herself to touch it. "
35.0,132,text_content,Terror threatened to overwhelm her. 
35.0,133,text_content,She fought it the only way she knew: ‘I ‘shall not fear. Fear is the mind-killer’ …’ 
35.0,134,text_content,The litany brought a semblance of calm. The other mote lay quiescent against her. 
35.0,135,text_content,"‘Words won’t work,’ Jessica told herself. "
35.0,136,text_content,"She reduced herself to basic emotional reactions, radiated love, comfort, a warm snuggling of protection. "
35.0,137,text_content,The terror receded. 
35.0,138,text_content,and one that lay quietly absorbing. 
35.0,139,text_content,can accept all this while remaining sane. But it must be: the needs of the tribe are paramount.’ 
35.0,140,text_content,‘What—’ 
35.0,141,text_content,‘Remain silent and accept!’ 
35.0,142,text_content,Experiences began to unroll before Jessica. It was like a lecture strip in a subliminal training projector at the Bene Gesserit school … but faster … blindingly faster. 
35.0,143,text_content,Yet … distinct. 
35.0,144,text_content,"strength and tenderness, all of him in one blink-moment, through the Reverend Mother’s memory. "
35.0,145,text_content,"poured in on Jessica – birth, life, death – important matters and unimportant, an outpouring of single-view time. "
35.0,146,text_content,‘Why should a fall of sand from a clifftop stick in the memory?’ she asked herself. 
35.0,147,text_content,the old Reverend Mother left her life in Jessica’s memory with one last sighing blur of words. 
35.0,148,text_content,"‘I’ve been a long time waiting for you,’ she said. ‘Here is my life.’ "
35.0,149,text_content,"There it was, encapsuled, all of it. "
35.0,150,text_content,Even the moment of death. 
35.0,151,text_content,"‘I am now a Reverend Mother,’ Jessica realized. "
35.0,152,text_content,Mother. The poison drug had transformed her. 
35.0,153,text_content,"of it, but she knew. "
35.0,154,text_content,The end result was the same. 
35.0,155,text_content,"Jessica sensed the daughter-mote still touching her inner awareness, probed it without response. "
35.0,156,text_content,as a pattern that had slowed and all life around her speeded up so that the dancing interplay became clearer. 
35.0,157,text_content,"The sensation of mote-awareness faded slightly, its intensity easing as her body relaxed from the threat of the poison, but still she felt that ‘other’ mote, touching it with a sense of guilt at what she had allowed to happen to it. "
35.0,158,text_content,varieties without any defenses.’ 
35.0,159,text_content,"A tiny outflowing of love-comfort, like a reflection of what she had poured into it, came from the other mote. "
35.0,160,text_content,"for it, realizing she was being impeded by a muzziness of the changed drug permeating her senses. "
35.0,161,text_content,"‘I could change that,’ she thought. ‘I could take away the drug action and make it harmless.’ But she sensed this would be an error. ‘I’m within a rite of joining.’ "
35.0,162,text_content,Then she knew what she had to do. 
35.0,163,text_content,"Jessica opened her eyes, gestured to the watersack now being held above her by Chani. "
35.0,164,text_content,in the blessing.’ 
35.0,165,text_content,a Reverend Mother has changed it.’ 
35.0,166,text_content,it difficult to focus.

35.0,168,text_content,"‘I have met the Reverend Mother Ramallo,’Jessica said. ‘She is gone, but she remains. Let her memory be honored in the rite.’ "
35.0,169,text_content,"‘Now, where did I get those’ words? Jessica wondered. "
35.0,170,text_content,"And she realized they came from another memory, the ‘life’ that had been given to her and now was part of herself. Something about that gift felt incomplete, though. "
35.0,171,text_content,"to become acquainted before I recede and pour out through your memories. Already, I feel myself being tied to bits of you. Ah-h-h, you’ve a mind filled with interesting things. So many things I’d never imagined.’ "

35.0,178,text_content,"Far down the inner corridor, another voice screamed: ‘Never to forgive! Never to forget!’ "
35.0,179,text_content,"dying sandworm, a maker. And as she saw the killing of it in her new memory, she suppressed a gasp. "
35.0,180,text_content,The creature was drowned! 
35.0,181,text_content,"‘Mother, are you all right?’ "
35.0,182,text_content,but resenting his presence. 
35.0,183,text_content,"‘I’m like a person whose hands were kept numb, without sensation from the first moment of awareness – until one day the ability to feel is forced into them.’ "
35.0,184,text_content,"The thought hung in her mind, an enclosing awareness. "
35.0,185,text_content,‘And I say: ‘Look! I have hands!’ But the people all around me say: ‘What are hands?’’

35.0,215,text_content,the others wanted. You … press on people. You … make us ‘see’ things!’ 
35.0,216,text_content,He forced himself to speak distinctly: ‘What do you see?’ 
35.0,217,text_content,can I know every feature of you?’ 
35.0,218,text_content,"‘They’ve a little of the talent,’ his mind told him. ‘But they suppress it because it terrifies.’ "
35.0,219,text_content,"In a moment of clarity, he saw how Chani was trembling. "
35.0,220,text_content,‘What is it you want to say?’ he asked. 
35.0,221,text_content,"‘Usul,’ she whispered, and still she trembled. "
35.0,222,text_content,"‘You cannot back into the future,’ he said. "
35.0,223,text_content,"A profound compassion for her swept through him. He pulled her against him, stroked her head. ‘Chani, Chani, don’t fear.’ "

36.0,4,text_content,the evening relaxation had already set in. 
36.0,5,text_content,eerie wailing of semuta music around him. His own court sat near to do his bidding. 
36.0,6,text_content,‘Nefud!’ the Baron roared. 
36.0,7,text_content,Men scrambled. 
36.0,8,text_content,stopped. 
36.0,9,text_content,"‘My Lord Baron,’ Nefud said. Only the drug kept the trembling out of his voice. "
36.0,10,text_content,"The Baron scanned the faces around him, seeing the looks of frantic quiet in them. He returned his attention to Nefud, and spoke in a silken tone: "
36.0,11,text_content,"‘How long have you been my guard captain, Nefud?’ "
36.0,12,text_content,"Nefud swallowed. ‘Since Arrakis, my Lord. Almost two years.’ "
36.0,13,text_content,‘And have you always anticipated dangers to my person?’ 
36.0,14,text_content,"‘Such has been my only desire, my Lord.’ "
36.0,15,text_content,‘Then where is Feyd-Rautha?’ the Baron roared. 
36.0,16,text_content,Nefud recoiled. ‘M’Lord?’ 
36.0,17,text_content,"‘You do not consider Feyd-Rautha a danger to my person?’ Again, the voice was silken. "
36.0,18,text_content,"Nefud wet his lips with his tongue. Some of the semuta dullness left his eyes. ‘Feyd-Rautha’s in the slave quarters, my Lord.’ "
36.0,19,text_content,"‘With the women again, eh?’ The Baron trembled with the effort of suppressing anger. "
36.0,20,text_content,"‘Sire, it could be he’s—’ "

36.0,23,text_content,he went into the quarters of the slave women?’ 
36.0,24,text_content,Nefud swallowed. Perspiration stood out on his forehead. 
36.0,25,text_content,"The Baron held his voice flat, almost devoid of emphasis: ‘Did I not say these things to you?’ "
36.0,26,text_content,Nefud nodded. 
36.0,27,text_content,‘And did I not say to you that you were to check all slave boys sent to me and that you were to do this yourself … ‘personally?’’ 
36.0,28,text_content,"Again, Nefud nodded. "
36.0,29,text_content,"‘Did you, perchance, not see the blemish on the thigh of the one sent me this evening?’ the Baron asked. ‘Is it possible you—’ "
36.0,30,text_content,‘Uncle.’ 
36.0,31,text_content,"The Baron whirled, stared at Feyd-Rautha standing in the doorway. The presence of his nephew here, now – the look of hurry that the young man could not quite conceal – all revealed much. Feyd-Rautha had his own spy system focused on the Baron. "

36.0,34,text_content,"‘Those two, eh?’ the Baron thought. ‘Ah, this young monster has much to learn yet about conspiracy!’ "
36.0,35,text_content,"‘I presume you left matters peaceful in the slave quarters, Feyd,’ the Baron said. "
36.0,36,text_content,have made a better choice. The boy was perfect!’ 
36.0,37,text_content,"‘Playing pyramid chess,’ the Baron said. ‘How nice. Did you win?’ "
36.0,38,text_content,"‘I … ah, yes, Uncle.’ And Feyd-Rautha strove to contain his disquiet. "
36.0,39,text_content,"The Baron snapped his fingers. ‘Nefud, you wish to be restored to my good graces?’ "
36.0,40,text_content,"‘Sire, what have I done?’ Nefud quavered. "
36.0,41,text_content,"‘That’s unimportant now,’ the Baron said. ‘Feyd has beaten the slavemaster at cheops. Did you hear that?’ "
36.0,42,text_content,‘Yes … Sire.’ 
36.0,43,text_content,when you’ve finished that I may see it was done properly. We cannot have such inept chess players in our employ.’ 
36.0,44,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha went pale, took a step forward. ‘But, Uncle I—’ "
36.0,45,text_content,"‘Later, Feyd,’ the Baron said, and waved a hand. ‘Later.’ "
36.0,46,text_content,"load sagging between them, arms trailing. The Baron watched until they were out of sight. "
36.0,47,text_content,"Nefud stepped up beside the Baron. ‘You wish me to kill the slavemaster, now, my Lord?’ "
36.0,48,text_content,"that body. One should do such things neatly. I’ll wish to see their carcasses, too.’ "
36.0,49,text_content,"Nefud said, ‘My Lord, is it anything that I’ve—’ "
36.0,50,text_content,"‘Do as your master has ordered,’ Feyd-Rautha said. And he thought: ‘All I can hope for now is to save my own skin.’ "
36.0,51,text_content,preserve myself while he’s learning.’ 
36.0,52,text_content,"Nefud signaled men to assist him, led them out the door. "
36.0,53,text_content,"‘Would you accompany me to my chambers, Feyd?’ the Baron asked. "
36.0,54,text_content,"‘I am yours to command,’ Feyd-Rautha said. He bowed, thinking: ‘I’m caught.’ "
36.0,55,text_content,"‘After you,’ the Baron said, and he gestured to the door. "
36.0,56,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha indicated his fear by only the barest hesitation. ‘Have I failed utterly?’ he asked himself. ‘Will he slip a poisoned blade into my back … slowly, through the shield? Does he have an alternative successor?’ "
36.0,57,text_content,"‘Let him experience this moment of terror,’ the Baron thought as he walked along behind his nephew. ‘He will succeed me, but at a time of my choosing. I’ll not have him throwing away what ‘I’ve built!’ "
36.0,58,text_content,blow would come. His muscles alternately tensed and relaxed. 
36.0,59,text_content,‘Have you heard the latest word from Arrakis?’ the Baron asked. 
36.0,60,text_content,"‘No, Uncle.’ "
36.0,61,text_content,Feyd-Rautha forced himself not to look back. He turned down the hall out of the servants’ wing. 
36.0,62,text_content,let them have their religion. It’ll keep them occupied.’ 
36.0,63,text_content,‘Why does he talk about religion? Is it some subtle hint to me?’ 
36.0,64,text_content,"‘Yes, isn’t it?’ the Baron said. "
36.0,65,text_content,"there – a suspensor lamp displaced, a bedcushion on the floor, a soother-reel spilled open across a bedstand. "
36.0,66,text_content,"enough. Tell me, Feyd, why didn’t you strike me down yourself? You’ve had opportunity enough.’ "
36.0,67,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha found a suspensor chair, accomplished a mental shrug as he sat down in it without being asked. "
36.0,68,text_content," ‘I must be bold now,’ he thought. "
36.0,69,text_content,"‘You taught me that my own hands must remain clean,’ he said. "
36.0,70,text_content,witch at the Emperor’s elbow will hear your words and know their truth or falsehood. Yes. I warned you about that.’ 
36.0,71,text_content,"‘Why haven’t you ever bought a Bene Gesserit, Uncle?’ Feyd-Rautha asked. ‘With a Truthsayer at your side—’ "
36.0,72,text_content,‘You know my tastes!’ the Baron snapped. 
36.0,73,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha studied his uncle, said: ‘Still, one would be valuable for—’ "
36.0,74,text_content,‘I trust them not!’ the Baron snarled. ‘And stop trying to change the subject!’ 
36.0,75,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha spoke mildly: ‘As you wish, Uncle.’ "
36.0,76,text_content,you. Is that truly how it was?’ 
36.0,77,text_content,"‘It’s been so long ago, Uncle. After all, I—’ "
36.0,78,text_content,"‘No evasions, please,’ the Baron said, and the tightness of his voice exposed the rein on his anger. "
36.0,79,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha looked at his uncle, thinking: ‘He knows, else he wouldn’t ask.’ "
36.0,80,text_content,"‘It was a sham, Uncle. I arranged it to discredit your slavemaster.’ "
36.0,81,text_content,"‘Very clever,’ the Baron said. ‘Brave, too. That slave-gladiator almost took you, didn’t he?’ "
36.0,82,text_content,‘Yes.’ 
36.0,83,text_content,was sometimes inscrutable. 
36.0,84,text_content,they’d prepared so carefully. 
36.0,85,text_content,we used this time to strike a bargain.’ 
36.0,86,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha stared at him. ‘A bargain! He means to keep me as his heir for certain, then. Else why bargain. One bargains with equals or near equals!’ "
36.0,87,text_content,that filled him. 
36.0,88,text_content,foolishness.’ 
36.0,89,text_content,"‘Get to the point, you old fool!’ Feyd-Rautha thought. "
36.0,90,text_content,"‘You think of me as an old fool,’ the Baron said. ‘I must dissuade you of that.’ "
36.0,91,text_content,‘You speak of a bargain.’ 
36.0,92,text_content,"in your favor. I will retire to an advisory position, leaving you in the seat of power.’ "
36.0,93,text_content,"‘Retire, Uncle?’ "
36.0,94,text_content,"it, eh? The smallest pressure and – snick! A poison needle in the old fool’s palm! Ah-h-h, Feyd …’ "
36.0,95,text_content,was the one who saved Hawat from the wreckage of Arrakis. And this lad needs greater respect for my prowess.’ 
36.0,96,text_content,live forever. Perhaps it was foolish to try hurrying the process.’ 
36.0,97,text_content,"‘You speak of a bargain,’ Feyd-Rautha said. ‘What pledge do we give to bind it?’ "
36.0,98,text_content,"live forever, can I, Feyd? And perhaps you should begin to suspect now that there’re things I know which you ‘should’ know.’ "
36.0,99,text_content,‘I give you my pledge and what do you give me?’ Feyd-Rautha asked. 
36.0,100,text_content,"‘I let you go on living,’ the Baron said. "
36.0,101,text_content,"He’d likely say I was lying in the attempt to discredit Hawat. No, the good Thufir is a Mentat and has anticipated this moment.’ "
36.0,102,text_content,"‘Well, what do you say?’ the Baron asked. "
36.0,103,text_content,"‘What can I say? I accept, of course.’ "
36.0,104,text_content,And Feyd-Rautha thought: ‘Hawat! He plays both ends against the middle … is that it? Has he moved to my uncle’s camp because I didn’t counsel with him over the slave boy attempt?’ 
36.0,105,text_content,"‘You haven’t said anything about my setting Hawat to watch you,’ the Baron said. "
36.0,106,text_content,so many years … and now it had a new meaning: still dangerous. 
36.0,107,text_content,"‘Hawat’s a dangerous toy,’ Feyd-Rautha said. "
36.0,108,text_content,"is the one to fear. But deep emotions … ah, now, those can be bent to your needs.’ "
36.0,109,text_content,"‘Uncle, I don’t understand you.’ "
36.0,110,text_content,"‘Yes, that’s plain enough.’ "
36.0,111,text_content,Only a flicker of eyelids betrayed the passage of resentment through Feyd-Rautha. 
36.0,112,text_content,"‘And you do not understand Hawat,’ the Baron said. "
36.0,113,text_content,‘Nor do you!’ Feyd-Rautha thought. 
36.0,114,text_content,"can best me any time. Believing this, he is bested. For I direct his attention where I want it – against the Imperium.’ "
36.0,115,text_content,"Tensions of a new understanding drew tight lines across Feyd-Rautha’s forehead, thinned his mouth. ‘Against the Emperor?’ "
36.0,116,text_content,worth the life of one old uncle who could make that dream come to pass!’ 
36.0,117,text_content,there seemed to be. 
36.0,118,text_content,‘And what has Hawat to do with this?’ Feyd-Rautha asked. 
36.0,119,text_content,‘He thinks he uses us to wreak his revenge upon the Emperor.’ 
36.0,120,text_content,‘And when that’s accomplished?’ 
36.0,121,text_content,"‘He does not think beyond revenge. Hawat’s a man who must serve others, and doesn’t even know this about himself.’ "
36.0,122,text_content,the more I feel we should dispose of him … and soon.’ 
36.0,123,text_content,‘You don’t like the idea of his watching you?’ 
36.0,124,text_content,‘Hawat watches everybody.’ 
36.0,125,text_content,death will sheathe him.’ 
36.0,126,text_content,"leans, which way he looks, how he holds his knife.’ "
36.0,127,text_content,"He nodded to himself, seeing that these words pleased his uncle, but thinking: ‘Yes! Like the arena! And the cutting edge is the mind!’ "
36.0,128,text_content,"‘Now you see how you need me,’ the Baron said. ‘I’m yet of use, Feyd.’ "
36.0,129,text_content,"‘A sword to be wielded until he’s too blunt for use,’ Feyd-Rautha thought. "
36.0,130,text_content,"‘Yes, Uncle,’ he said. "
36.0,131,text_content,kill all the women in the pleasure wing.’ 
36.0,132,text_content,‘Uncle!’ 
36.0,133,text_content,"‘There will be other women, Feyd. But I have said that you do not make a mistake casually with me.’ "
36.0,134,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha’s face darkened. ‘Uncle, you—’ "
36.0,135,text_content,"‘You will accept your punishment and learn something from it,’ the Baron said. "
36.0,136,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha met the gloating stare in his uncle’s eyes. ‘And I must remember this night,’ he thought. ‘And remembering it, I must remember other nights.’ "
36.0,137,text_content,"‘You will not refuse,’ the Baron said. "
36.0,138,text_content,to bend him. 
36.0,139,text_content,"‘I know you, Feyd,’ the Baron said. ‘You will not refuse.’ ‘All right,’ Feyd-Rautha thought. ‘I need you now. I see that. The bargain’s made. But I’ll not always need you. And … someday …’ "

37.0,11,text_content,"‘You speak too casually of Salusa Secundus,’ Hawat said. "
37.0,12,text_content,"‘It’s a penal colony,’ the Baron said. ‘The worst riff-raff in the galaxy are sent to Salusa Secundus. What else do we need to know?’ "

37.0,15,text_content,‘And curiosity about Salusa Secundus is … ah …’ Hawat put a bony finger to his lips. ‘… discouraged.’ 
37.0,16,text_content,‘So he’s not proud of some of the things he must do there!’ 
37.0,17,text_content,‘And you’ve never wondered where the Emperor gets his Sardaukar?’ 
37.0,18,text_content,"as he said: ‘Why … he recruits … that is to say, there are the levies and he enlists from—’ "
37.0,19,text_content,"first-hand accounts from the limited number of survivors who’ve fought against the Sardaukar, eh?’ "
37.0,20,text_content,"‘The Sardaukar are excellent fighting men, no doubt of it,’ the Baron said. ‘But I think my own legions—’ "
37.0,21,text_content,Atreides?’ 
37.0,22,text_content,"‘This is not a realm open to your speculation,’ the Baron warned. "
37.0,23,text_content,‘Is it possible that even he doesn’t know what motivated the Emperor in this?’ Hawat asked himself. 
37.0,24,text_content,information or computation lines from a Mentat.’ 
37.0,25,text_content,"For a long minute, the Baron stared at him, then: ‘Say what you must say, Mentat.’ "
37.0,26,text_content,"to enlarge his force, to make it every bit as strong as the Emperor’s.’ "
37.0,27,text_content,"The Baron weighed this disclosure, then: ‘What has Arrakis to do with this?’ "
37.0,28,text_content,‘It provides a pool of recruits already conditioned to the bitterest survival training.’ 
37.0,29,text_content,The Baron shook his head. ‘You cannot mean the Fremen?’ 
37.0,30,text_content,‘I mean the Fremen.’ 
37.0,31,text_content,‘Hah! Then why warn Rabban? There cannot be more than a handful of Fremen left after the Sardaukar pogrom and Rabban’s oppression.’ 
37.0,32,text_content,Hawat continued to stare at him silently. 
37.0,33,text_content,‘Not more than a handful!’ the Baron repeated. ‘Rabban killed six thousand of them last year alone!’ 
37.0,34,text_content,"Still, Hawat stared at him. "
37.0,35,text_content,least twenty thousand.’ 
37.0,36,text_content,‘What are Rabban’s troop losses for the past two years?’ Hawat asked. 
37.0,37,text_content,and—’ 
37.0,38,text_content,‘Shall we say thirty thousand in round numbers?’ Hawat asked. 
37.0,39,text_content,"‘That would seem a little high,’ the Baron said. "
37.0,40,text_content,must’ve understood my reports from our agents.’ 
37.0,41,text_content,"‘Arrakis is a fierce planet,’ the Baron said. ‘Storm losses can—’ "
37.0,42,text_content,"‘We both know the figure for storm accretion,’ Hawat said. "
37.0,43,text_content,"‘What if he has lost thirty thousand?’ the Baron demanded, and blood darkened his face. "
37.0,44,text_content,"almost five for one. Why won’t you face these figures, Baron, and understand what they mean?’ "
37.0,45,text_content,"The Baron spoke in a coldly measured cadence: ‘This is your job, Mentat. What do they mean?’ "

37.0,58,text_content,"The Baron fell silent, eyes unfocused. The possibilities – had Rabban unwittingly given House Harkonnen its ultimate weapon? "

37.0,63,text_content,‘Such an idea!’ the Baron whispered. 
37.0,64,text_content,"‘You begin to share my suspicions,’ Hawat said. "
37.0,65,text_content,‘Where did such a thing start?’ the Baron asked. 
37.0,66,text_content,"of prisoners there? Even the Duke Leto, a cousin on the distaff side, never knew for sure. Such questions were not encouraged.’ "
37.0,67,text_content,"The Baron’s eyes glazed with thought. ‘Yes, a very carefully kept secret. They’d use every device of—’ "

37.0,70,text_content,"Hawat broke off, studied the Baron with a puzzled frown. ‘What of Count Fenring?’ "
37.0,71,text_content,"‘At my nephew’s birthday several years ago,’ the Baron said. ‘This Imperial popinjay, Count Fenring, came as official observer and to … ah, conclude a business arrangement between the Emperor and myself.’ "
37.0,72,text_content,‘So?’ 
37.0,73,text_content,"‘I … ah, during one of our conversations, I believe I said something about making a prison planet of Arrakis. Fenring—’ "
37.0,74,text_content,‘What did you say exactly?’ Hawat asked. 
37.0,75,text_content,‘Exactly? That was quite a while ago and—’ 
37.0,76,text_content,recorded?’ 
37.0,77,text_content,The Baron’s face darkened with anger. ‘You’re as bad as Piter! I don’t like these—’

37.0,79,text_content,"‘He became too familiar, too demanding of me,’ the Baron said. "

37.0,87,text_content,‘Nothing is innocent in an Emperor’s eyes! What were your instructions to Rabban?’ 
37.0,88,text_content,‘Merely that he should teach Arrakis to fear us.’

37.0,94,text_content,The Baron’s lips quivered. ‘What is your alternative?’ 
37.0,95,text_content,"‘Abandon your dear nephew, Rabban.’ "

37.0,107,text_content,Yes. Your Feyd-Rautha can go to Arrakis as their savior. He can win the populace. Yes.’

40.0,13,text_content,"that drink without fear? I could alter any poison now before it did me harm, of course, but the donor doesn’t realize this.’ "
40.0,14,text_content,"She drained the cup, feeling the energy and lift of its contents – hot and delicious. "
40.0,15,text_content,tinge of fear. 
40.0,16,text_content,they felt and reacted sometimes like a single organism. 
40.0,17,text_content,And the thought of coincidence never entered their minds. 
40.0,18,text_content,"‘Has Paul passed his test on the sand?’ Jessica asked herself. ‘He’s capable, but accident can strike down even the most capable.’ "
40.0,19,text_content,The waiting. 
40.0,20,text_content,"‘It’s the dreariness,’ she thought. ‘You can wait just so long. Then the dreariness of the waiting overcomes you.’ "
40.0,21,text_content,There was all manner of waiting in their lives. 
40.0,22,text_content,"the Mudir Nahya, the Beast Rabban.’ "
40.0,23,text_content,‘Reverend Mother?’ 
40.0,24,text_content,"The voice from outside the hangings at her door was that of Harah, the other woman in Paul’s menage. "
40.0,25,text_content,"‘Yes, Harah.’ "
40.0,26,text_content,"and oily against her head. The jutting, predatory features were drawn into an intense frown. "
40.0,27,text_content,"Behind Harah came Alia, a girl-child of about two years. "
40.0,28,text_content,no two-year-old had ever encountered. 
40.0,29,text_content,"Harah sank to a cushion with an exasperated sigh, frowned at the child. "
40.0,30,text_content,‘Alia.’Jessica motioned to her daughter. 
40.0,31,text_content,"awareness of another living spark, a sharp and poignant thing, a ‘nerve-simpatico’ that made them emotionally one. "
40.0,32,text_content,you well?’ 
40.0,33,text_content,"With the same traditional formality, she said: ‘Subakh un nar. I am well.’ The words were almost toneless. Again, she sighed. "
40.0,34,text_content,Jessica sensed amusement from Alia. 
40.0,35,text_content,"‘My brother’s ghanima is annoyed with me,’ Alia said in her half-lisp. "
40.0,36,text_content,a spearhead used as a curtain weight. 
40.0,37,text_content,"Harah scowled at the child. ‘Don’t try to insult me, child. I know my place.’ "
40.0,38,text_content,"‘What have you done this time, Alia?’Jessica asked. "
40.0,39,text_content,"Harah answered: ‘Not only has she refused to play with the other children today, but she intruded where …’ "
40.0,40,text_content,of lungs! When he’d cried long enough—’

40.0,43,text_content,"‘It’s just made more talk among the people,’ Harah said. "
40.0,44,text_content,‘Subiay’s boy is healthy?’Jessica asked. She saw that something was troubling Harah deeply and wondered at it. 
40.0,45,text_content,He settled down right away and was happy. It was …’ Harah shrugged. 
40.0,46,text_content,things no child her age could know – things of the past.’ 
40.0,47,text_content,‘How could she know what a child looked like on Bela Tegeuse?’ Harah demanded. 
40.0,48,text_content,‘But he does!’ Alia said. ‘Subiay’s boy looks just like the son of Mitha born before the parting.’ 
40.0,49,text_content,‘Alia!’Jessica said. ‘I warned you.’ 
40.0,50,text_content,"‘But, Mother, I saw it and it was true and …’ "

40.0,55,text_content,"‘She has so little in common with the other children,’ Jessica said. ‘She’s no demon. It’s just the—’ "
40.0,56,text_content,‘Of course she’s not!’ 
40.0,57,text_content,radiating a sense of … waiting. Jessica returned her attention to Harah. 
40.0,58,text_content,openly with me of whatever’s troubling you.’ 
40.0,59,text_content,the special training ‘they’ receive as the children of Usul. It’s little enough I could give them since it’s known I don’t share your son’s bed.’ 
40.0,60,text_content,"Again Alia stirred beside her, half-sleeping, warm. "
40.0,61,text_content,"companionship with Chani had become the permanent thing, the marriage. "
40.0,62,text_content,reasons than love. 
40.0,63,text_content,‘You think I don’t know what you plan for your son?’ Harah asked. 
40.0,64,text_content,‘What do you mean?’Jessica demanded. 
40.0,65,text_content,"‘You plan to unite the tribes under ‘Him,’’ Harah said. "
40.0,66,text_content,‘Is that bad?’ 
40.0,67,text_content,‘I see danger for him … and Alia is part of that danger.’ 
40.0,68,text_content,"Alia nestled closer to her mother, eyes opened now and studying Harah. "
40.0,69,text_content,when we fled here. I’ve seen many things about her.’ 
40.0,70,text_content,"Jessica nodded, feeling disquiet begin to grow in Alia beside her. "
40.0,71,text_content,"baby who knew the water discipline so young? What other baby’s first words to her nurse were: “I love you, Harah”?’ "
40.0,72,text_content,Harah stared at Alia. ‘Why do you think I accept her insults? I know there’s no malice in them.’ 
40.0,73,text_content,Alia looked up at her mother.

40.0,75,text_content,"‘Harah …’Jessica shrugged. ‘I don’t know what to say.’ And she felt surprised at herself, because this literally was true. "
40.0,76,text_content,"Alia straightened, squared her shoulders. Jessica felt the sense of waiting ended, an emotion compounded of decision and sadness. "
40.0,77,text_content,"‘We made a mistake,’ Alia said. ‘Now we need Harah.’ "
40.0,78,text_content,within you.’ 
40.0,79,text_content,‘Need Harah?’ Jessica asked herself. 
40.0,80,text_content,‘Who else can talk among the people and make them begin to understand me?’ Alia asked. 
40.0,81,text_content,‘What would you have her do?’Jessica asked.

40.0,85,text_content,"‘I know I’m a freak,’ Alia whispered. The adult summation coming from the child mouth was like a bitter confirmation. "
40.0,86,text_content,‘You’re not a freak!’ Harah snapped. ‘Who dared say you’re a freak?’ 
40.0,87,text_content,as though this were her own child. 
40.0,88,text_content,‘Who said it?’ Harah repeated. 
40.0,89,text_content,‘Nobody.’ 
40.0,90,text_content,it. 
40.0,91,text_content,"‘Then don’t you say it,’ Harah ordered. "
40.0,92,text_content,"‘Yes, Harah.’ "
40.0,93,text_content,"‘Now,’ Harah said, ‘you may tell me what it was like so that I may tell the others. Tell me what it is that happened to you.’ "
40.0,94,text_content,"Alia swallowed, looked up at her mother. "
40.0,95,text_content,Jessica nodded. 
40.0,96,text_content,"warm, dark place. And I was frightened.’ "
40.0,97,text_content,"Listening to the half-lisping voice of her daughter, Jessica remembered that day in the big cavern. "

40.0,99,text_content,"intensity as though they, too, were trying to hear Alia’s words. "
40.0,100,text_content,And Jessica thought: ‘What do we really know of how such a one thinks … out of her unique experiences and training and ancestry?’ 
40.0,101,text_content,find myself again. There were so many others.’ 
40.0,102,text_content,that happened to you.’ 
40.0,103,text_content,just happened … everything …’ 
40.0,104,text_content,"‘We didn’t know,’ Harah murmured. ‘When we gave your mother the Water to change, we didn’t know you existed within her.’ "
40.0,105,text_content,I’m a Reverend Mother. The tribe has two Rev …’ 
40.0,106,text_content,"She broke off, tipping her head to listen. "
40.0,107,text_content,"Harah rocked back on her heels against the sitting cushion, stared at Alia, bringing her attention then up to Jessica’s face. "
40.0,108,text_content,‘Didn’t you suspect?’Jessica asked. 
40.0,109,text_content,"‘Sh-h-h-h,’ Alia said. "

40.0,114,text_content,"‘Life was full with happiness until the raiders came,’ Alia said. "
40.0,115,text_content,pasts she shared. 
40.0,116,text_content,"‘La, la, la, the women cried,’ said Harah. "
40.0,117,text_content,"‘The raiders came through the mushtamal, rushing at us with their knives dripping red from the lives of our men,’Jessica said. "

40.0,120,text_content,"‘We will never forgive and we will never forget,’ Harah said. "

40.0,122,text_content,‘Reverend Mother?’ 
40.0,123,text_content,"A woman’s voice, and Jessica recognized it: the voice of Tharthar, one of Stilgar’s wives. "
40.0,124,text_content,"‘What is it, Tharthar?’ "
40.0,125,text_content,"‘There is trouble, Reverend Mother.’ "
40.0,126,text_content,"Jessica felt a constriction at her heart, an abrupt fear for Paul. ‘Paul …’ she gasped. "
40.0,127,text_content,"on Jessica, the nostrils of her tiny nose dilated to reveal the plug scars. "
40.0,128,text_content,‘What is it?’Jessica demanded. 
40.0,129,text_content,will force him to call out Stilgar and assume command of the tribes.’ 
40.0,130,text_content,They want to fight.’ 
40.0,131,text_content,"Tharthar shifted from one foot to the other, cleared her throat. "
40.0,132,text_content,of purpose if the waiting’s prolonged.’ 
40.0,133,text_content,"‘The young men say if Usul does not call out Stilgar, then he must be afraid,’ Tharthar said. "
40.0,134,text_content,She lowered her gaze. 
40.0,135,text_content,"‘So that’s the way of it,’Jessica muttered. And she thought: ‘Well, I saw it coming. As did Stilgar.’ "
40.0,136,text_content,"Again, Tharthar cleared her throat. ‘Even my brother, Shoab, says it,’ she said. ‘They will leave Usul no choice.’ "
40.0,137,text_content,"‘Then it has come,’ Jessica thought. ‘And Paul will have to handle it himself. The Reverend Mother dare not become involved in the succession.’ "
40.0,138,text_content,"Alia freed her hand from her mother’s, said: ‘I will go with Tharthar and listen to the young men. Perhaps there is a way. "
40.0,139,text_content,"‘Jessica met Tharthar’s gaze, but spoke to Alia: ‘Go, then. And report to me as soon as you can.’ "
40.0,140,text_content,"‘We do not want this thing to happen, Reverend Mother,’ Tharthar said. "
40.0,141,text_content,"‘We do not want it,’ Jessica agreed. ‘The tribe needs ‘all’ its strength.’ She glanced at Harah. ‘Will you go with them?’ "
40.0,142,text_content,‘We have an understanding.’ 
40.0,143,text_content,"Tharthar held out a hand for Alia, said: ‘We must hurry. The young men are leaving.’ "
40.0,144,text_content,"They pressed through the hangings, the child’s hand in the small woman’s hand, but the child seemed to be leading. "
40.0,145,text_content,but times have changed.’ 
40.0,146,text_content,"‘Times have changed for you, as well,’Jessica said. "
40.0,147,text_content,"‘You cannot think I doubt the outcome of such a battle,’ Harah said. ‘Usul could not but win.’ "
40.0,148,text_content,"‘That was my meaning,’Jessica said. "
40.0,149,text_content,"neck. ‘How wrong you are. Perhaps you think, as well, that I regret not being the chosen of Usul, that I am jealous of Chani?’ "
40.0,150,text_content,"‘You make your own choice as you are able,’Jessica said. "
40.0,151,text_content,"‘I pity Chani,’ Harah said. "
40.0,152,text_content,Jessica stiffened. ‘What do you mean?’ 
40.0,153,text_content,"‘I know what you think of Chani,’ Harah said. ‘You think she is not the wife for your son.’ "
40.0,154,text_content,"Jessica settled back, relaxed on her cushions. She shrugged. ‘Perhaps.’ "
40.0,155,text_content,for ‘Him.’ ’ 
40.0,156,text_content,"Jessica swallowed past a sudden tightening in her throat. ‘Chani’s very dear to me,’ she said. ‘She could be no—’ "

41.0,6,text_content,‘How far outside the maker’s radius must you stand in pea sand?’ Stilgar had asked him. 
41.0,7,text_content,And he had answered correctly: ‘Half a meter for every meter of the maker’s diameter.’ 
41.0,8,text_content,‘Why?’

41.0,20,text_content,"Stilgar moved up through the ranks, checked the positioning of Paul’s hooks, glanced up at Paul’s smiling face. "
41.0,21,text_content,left where you waited. You could not retreat there if the worm turned that way.’ 
41.0,22,text_content,The smile slipped from Paul’s face. ‘I saw the drumsand.’ 
41.0,23,text_content,‘Then why did you not signal for one of us to take up position secondary to you? It was a thing you could do even in the test.’ 
41.0,24,text_content,"Paul swallowed, faced into the wind of their passage. "
41.0,25,text_content,"into that drumsand, the maker would’ve turned toward you.’ "
41.0,26,text_content,"he had received from his mother for Paul to recapture a feeling of calm. ‘I apologize,’ he said. ‘It will not happen again.’ "

41.0,28,text_content,He slapped Paul’s shoulder. 
41.0,29,text_content,"‘We work together,’ Paul agreed. "
41.0,30,text_content,"‘Now,’ Stilgar said, and his voice was harsh, ‘show me you know how to handle a maker. Which side are we on?’ "

41.0,32,text_content,"a straight course as it rolled. When he had it turned, he motioned two steersmen out of the line and into positions ahead. "
41.0,33,text_content,"‘Ach, haiiiii-yoh!’ he shouted in the traditional call. The leftside steersman opened a ring segment there. "
41.0,34,text_content,"south, Paul shouted: ‘Geyrat!’ "
41.0,35,text_content,The steersman released his hook. The maker lined out in a straight course. 
41.0,36,text_content,"Stilgar said: ‘Very good, Paul-Muad’Dib. With plenty of practice, you may yet become a sandrider.’ "
41.0,37,text_content,"Paul frowned, thinking: ‘Was I not first up?’ "
41.0,38,text_content,"From behind him there came sudden laughter. The troops began chanting, flinging his name against the sky. "
41.0,39,text_content,‘Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib!’ 
41.0,40,text_content,"And far to the rear along the worm’s surface, Paul heard the beat of the goaders pounding the tail segments. The worm began picking up speed. Their robes flapped in the wind. The abrasive sound of their passage increased. "

41.0,42,text_content,‘Hal yawm! You are a sandrider this day.’

41.0,58,text_content,"‘You cannot guess what I want,’ Paul said. "

41.0,60,text_content,"‘You are mudir of the sandride this day,’ Stilgar said. Cold formality rang in his voice. ‘How do you use this power?’ "
41.0,61,text_content,"‘We need time to relax, time for cool reflection,’ Paul thought. "
41.0,62,text_content,"‘We shall go south,’ Paul said. "
41.0,63,text_content,‘Even if I say we shall return back to the north when this day is over?’ 
41.0,64,text_content,"‘We shall go south,’ Paul repeated. "
41.0,65,text_content,‘I will send the messages.’ 
41.0,66,text_content,"‘He thinks I will call him out,’ Paul thought. ‘And he knows he cannot stand against me.’ "
41.0,67,text_content,"Paul faced south, feeling the wind against his exposed cheeks, thinking of the necessities that went into his decisions. "

41.0,86,text_content,"‘We should leave this maker in deep sand,’ Paul said. "
41.0,87,text_content,"‘Yes,’ Stilgar agreed. ‘We could walk to the cave from here.’ "
41.0,88,text_content,"‘We’ve ridden him far enough that he’ll bury himself and sulk for a day or so,’ Paul said. "

41.0,95,text_content,"Chani dropped. Presently, only he and Stilgar remained. "

41.0,108,text_content,"‘It was a smuggler craft,’ Stilgar said. "
41.0,109,text_content,"‘So it seemed,’ Paul said. ‘But this is deep into the desert for smugglers.’ "
41.0,110,text_content,"‘They’ve their difficulties with patrols, too,’ Stilgar said. "
41.0,111,text_content,"‘If they come this deep, they may go deeper,’ Paul said. "
41.0,112,text_content,‘True.’ 
41.0,113,text_content,too.’ 
41.0,114,text_content,"‘They were hunting spice, don’t you think?’ Stilgar asked. "
41.0,115,text_content,catch us some smugglers. They should be taught that this is our land and our men need practice with the new weapons.’ 
41.0,116,text_content,"‘Now, Usul speaks,’ Stilgar said. ‘Usul thinks Fremen.’ "
41.0,117,text_content,"‘But Usul must give way to decisions that match a terrible purpose,’ Paul thought. And the storm was gathering. "

42.0,34,text_content,"‘Leave the knife in its sheath, Gurney Halleck,’ the man said. "
42.0,35,text_content,Gurney hesitated. That voice sounded oddly familiar even through a stillsuit filter.

42.0,37,text_content,his robe. ‘Tell your men to stop their useless resistance.’

42.0,40,text_content,"‘Paul,’ he whispered. Then louder: ‘Is it truly Paul?’ "
42.0,41,text_content,‘Don’t you trust your own eyes?’ Paul asked. 
42.0,42,text_content,"‘They said you were dead,’ Gurney rasped. He took a half-step forward. "
42.0,43,text_content,"‘Tell your men to submit,’ Paul commanded. He waved toward the lower reaches of the ridge. "

42.0,46,text_content,"Slowly, warily, the struggling figures separated. Eyes turned toward him, questioning. "
42.0,47,text_content,"‘These are friends,’ Gurney called. "
42.0,48,text_content,‘Fine friends!’ someone shouted back. ‘Half our people murdered.’ 
42.0,49,text_content,"‘It’s a mistake,’ Gurney said. ‘Don’t add to it.’ "
42.0,50,text_content,"He turned back to Paul, stared into the youth’s blue-blue Fremen eyes. "
42.0,51,text_content,a squint to the eyes and calculation in the glance that seemed to weigh everything in sight. 
42.0,52,text_content,"‘They said you were dead,’ Gurney repeated. "

42.0,57,text_content,‘You young pup! You young pup!’ Gurney kept saying.

42.0,61,text_content,than question. They’d have gone hunting for answers.’ 
42.0,62,text_content,"from the death commandos back to Gurney. Finding his former swordmaster filled him with elation. He saw it as a good omen, a sign that he was on the course of the future where all was well. "
42.0,63,text_content,‘With Gurney at my side …’ 
42.0,64,text_content,"Paul glanced down the ridge past the Fedaykin, studied the smuggler crew who had come with Halleck. "
42.0,65,text_content,"‘How do your men stand, Gurney?’ he asked. "
42.0,66,text_content,"‘They’re smugglers all,’ Gurney said. ‘They stand where the profit is.’ "
42.0,67,text_content,– the old hand code out of their past. There were men to fear and distrust in the smuggler crew.

42.0,71,text_content,"wasn’t like Stilgar, who was a leader of Fremen, a man who spoke his mind. "

42.0,73,text_content,crew disarmed until they could be questioned. 
42.0,74,text_content,he barked. ‘This is the rightful Duke of Arrakis. Do as he commands.’ 
42.0,75,text_content,"Grumbling, the smugglers submitted. "
42.0,76,text_content,"Paul moved up beside Gurney, spoke in a low voice. ‘I’d not have expected you to walk into this trap, Gurney.’ "
42.0,77,text_content,to lure us.’ 
42.0,78,text_content,your crew?’ 
42.0,79,text_content,‘None. We’re spread thin. There’re a few among the free traders. Most have spent their profits to leave this place. 
42.0,80,text_content,‘But you stayed.’ 
42.0,81,text_content,‘I stayed.’ 
42.0,82,text_content,"‘Because Rabban is here,’ Paul said. "
42.0,83,text_content,"‘I thought I had nothing left but revenge,’ Gurney said. "
42.0,84,text_content,An oddly chopped cry sounded from the ridgetop. Gurney looked up to see a Fremen waving his kerchief. 
42.0,85,text_content,toward the ridge. 
42.0,86,text_content,"‘He’s big enough,’ Paul said. "
42.0,87,text_content,the rocks. 
42.0,88,text_content,"‘Too bad we couldn’t have saved the carryall,’ Paul said. "
42.0,89,text_content,been more concerned for the men he couldn’t save.’ 
42.0,90,text_content,"though, they were trespassers who might see things they shouldn’t see. You must understand that.’ "

42.0,93,text_content,none of them appeared worried by the approach of the worm.

42.0,96,text_content,"‘There’s one of the things you shouldn’t have seen,’ Paul said. "

42.0,101,text_content,‘To us’ … ‘to us …’ 
42.0,102,text_content,"Gurney shook his head to drive out such thoughts. ‘We weren’t the shock to you that you were to us,’ he said. "
42.0,103,text_content,‘What’s the talk of Rabban in the sinks and villages?’ Paul asked. 
42.0,104,text_content,their defenses while you wear yourselves out in futile attack.’ 
42.0,105,text_content,"‘In a word,’ Paul said, ‘they’re immobilized.’ "
42.0,106,text_content,"‘While you can go where you will,’ Gurney said. "
42.0,107,text_content,"‘It’s a tactic I learned from you,’ Paul said. ‘They’ve lost the initiative, which means they’ve lost the war.’ "

42.0,113,text_content,"‘Chani,’ Paul said, ‘this is Gurney Halleck. You’ve heard me speak of him.’ "
42.0,114,text_content,"She looked at Halleck, back to Paul. ‘I have heard.’ "
42.0,115,text_content,‘Where did the men go on the maker?’ Paul asked. 
42.0,116,text_content,‘They but diverted it to give us time to save the equipment.’ 
42.0,117,text_content,"‘Well then …’ Paul broke off, sniffed the air. "
42.0,118,text_content,"‘There’s wind coming,’ Chani said. "
42.0,119,text_content,"A voice called out from the ridgetop above them: ‘Ho, there – the wind!’ "
42.0,120,text_content,it so neatly that the passage escaped his eyes. 
42.0,121,text_content,‘Have you many such hiding places?’ Gurney asked. 
42.0,122,text_content,smuggler crew who’re not to be trusted.’ 
42.0,123,text_content,"She looked once at Gurney, back to Paul, nodded, and was off down the rocks, leaping with a gazelle-like agility. "
42.0,124,text_content,"‘She is your woman,’ Gurney said. "
42.0,125,text_content,"‘The mother of my firstborn,’ Paul said. ‘There’s another Leto among the Atreides.’ "
42.0,126,text_content,Gurney accepted this with only a widening of the eyes. 
42.0,127,text_content,bursts and gusts of wind that whipped dust around their heads. 
42.0,128,text_content,"‘Seal your suit,’ Paul said. And he fastened the mask and hood about his face. "
42.0,129,text_content,"Gurney obeyed, thankful for the filters. "
42.0,130,text_content,"Paul spoke, his voice muffled by the filter: ‘Which of your crew don’t you trust, Gurney?’ "
42.0,131,text_content,"‘There’re some new recruits,’ Gurney said. ‘Offworlders …’ He hesitated, wondering at himself suddenly. ‘Offworlders,’ The word had come so easily to his tongue. "
42.0,132,text_content,‘Yes?’ Paul said. 
42.0,133,text_content,"‘They’re not like the usual fortune-hunting lot we get,’ Gurney said. ‘They’re tougher.’ "
42.0,134,text_content,‘Harkonnen spies?’ Paul asked. 
42.0,135,text_content,Secundus about them.’ 
42.0,136,text_content,Paul shot a sharp glance at him. ‘Sardaukar?’ 
42.0,137,text_content,"Gurney shrugged. ‘They could be, but it’s well masked.’ "
42.0,138,text_content,"… differences. Arrakis had changed him, too. "
42.0,139,text_content,"Two hooded Fremen emerged from the broken rock below them, began climbing upward. One of them carried a large black bundle over one shoulder. "
42.0,140,text_content,‘Where are my crew now?’ Gurney asked. 
42.0,141,text_content,storm.’ 
42.0,142,text_content,A voice called from above them: ‘Muad’Dib!’ 
42.0,143,text_content,"Paul turned at the call, saw a Fremen guard motioning them down to the cave. Paul signaled he had heard. "
42.0,144,text_content,Gurney was studying him with a new expression. ‘You’re Muad’Dib?’ he asked. ‘You’re the will-o’-the-sand?’ 
42.0,145,text_content,"‘It’s my Fremen name,’ Paul said. "
42.0,146,text_content,into battle with their death chants on their lips. 
42.0,147,text_content,‘Him.’ 
42.0,148,text_content,We best get below now.’ 
42.0,149,text_content,‘Right.’ 
42.0,150,text_content,of the new Fremen legends. 
42.0,151,text_content,"Paul looked at the bundle the other man carried, said: ‘Korba, what’s in the bundle?’ "
42.0,152,text_content,I heard you speak of the prowess of Gurney Halleck on the baliset.’ 
42.0,153,text_content,"Gurney studied the speaker, seeing the edge of black beard above the stillsuit mask, the hawk stare, the chiseled nose. "
42.0,154,text_content,"‘You’ve a companion who thinks, m’Lord,’ Gurney said. ‘Thank you, Stilgar.’ "
42.0,155,text_content,here.’ 
42.0,156,text_content,"Paul even in the times before Arrakis, a man who shared a camaraderie that Stilgar could never invade. "
42.0,157,text_content,"‘You are two I’d have be friends,’ Paul said. "
42.0,158,text_content,"‘Stilgar, the Fremen, is a name of renown,’ Gurney said. ‘Any killer of Harkonnens I’d feel honored to count among my friends.’ "
42.0,159,text_content,"‘Will you touch hands with my friend Gurney Halleck, Stilgar?’ Paul asked. "
42.0,160,text_content,"of Gurney Halleck,’ he said, and released his grip. He turned to Paul. ‘The storm comes rushing.’ "
42.0,161,text_content,"‘At once,’ Paul said. "
42.0,162,text_content,with a raised ledge on one side and a passage leading off from it. 
42.0,163,text_content,"opposite the entrance. Paul led the way through an anteroom and into a chamber with dark, wine-colored hangings on its walls. "
42.0,164,text_content,"‘We can have some privacy here for a while,’ Paul said. ‘The others will respect my—’ "
42.0,165,text_content,"the outer chamber. Gurney was right behind him, weapon drawn. "
42.0,166,text_content,"crouched in trios, backed into triangles where pressed. "
42.0,167,text_content,That habit of close fighting was a trademark of the Imperial Sardaukar. 
42.0,168,text_content,"A Fedaykin in the crowd saw Paul, and his battlecry was lifted to echo in the chamber: ‘Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib!’ "
42.0,169,text_content,"stone behind him, glanced to see Gurney retrieve it. "
42.0,170,text_content,The triangular knots were being pressed back now.

42.0,172,text_content,Sardaukar for certain. 
42.0,173,text_content,lay in a twisted pattern across the chamber. 
42.0,174,text_content,‘Hold!’ Paul shouted. ‘The Duke Paul Atreides commands you to hold!’ 
42.0,175,text_content,"The fighting wavered, hesitated. "
42.0,176,text_content,"men started to press in around the Sardaukar: ‘Hold, I say!’ "
42.0,177,text_content,One of the cornered trio straightened. ‘Who says we’re Sardaukar?’ he demanded. 
42.0,178,text_content,"Paul took the knife from Gurney, held it aloft. ‘This says you’re Sardaukar.’ "
42.0,179,text_content,‘Then who says you’re a ruling Duke?’ the man demanded. 
42.0,180,text_content,Paul gestured to the Fedaykin. ‘These men say I’m a ruling Duke. Your own emperor bestowed Arrakis on House Atreides. I am House Atreides.’ 
42.0,181,text_content,"The Sardaukar stood silent, fidgeting. "
42.0,182,text_content,appear fully clothed though naked. 
42.0,183,text_content,"Paul glanced to one of his Fedaykin lieutenants, said: ‘Korba, how came they to have weapons?’ "

42.0,185,text_content,words. The lieutenant lowered his eyes. 
42.0,186,text_content,"‘Where is Chani?’ Paul asked and waited, breath held, for the answer. "
42.0,187,text_content,"for this mistake, Muad’Dib.’ "
42.0,188,text_content,"‘How many of these Sardaukar were there, Gurney?’ Paul asked. "
42.0,189,text_content,‘Ten.’ 
42.0,190,text_content,"Paul leaped lightly to the floor of the chamber, strode across to stand within striking distance of the Sardaukar spokesman. "
42.0,191,text_content,prevent because the Fremen wished to preserve the wisdom of Muad’Dib. 
42.0,192,text_content,"Without turning, Paul spoke to his lieutenant: ‘How many are our casualties?’ "
42.0,193,text_content,"‘Four wounded, two dead, Muad’Dib.’ "
42.0,194,text_content,"Sardaukar, staring into the offworld whites of the spokesman’s eyes. ‘You, what is your name?’ Paul demanded. "
42.0,195,text_content,"The man stiffened, glanced left and right. "
42.0,196,text_content,"‘Don’t try it,’ Paul said. ‘It’s obvious to me that you were ordered to seek out and destroy Muad’Dib. I’ll warrant you were the ones suggested seeking spice in the deep desert.’ "
42.0,197,text_content,A gasp from Gurney behind him brought a thin smile to Paul’s lips. 
42.0,198,text_content,Blood suffused the Sardaukar’s face. 
42.0,199,text_content,"against Sardaukar, eh?’ "
42.0,200,text_content,"The man came up on his toes, sank back as the Fedaykin pressed forward. "
42.0,201,text_content,"‘I asked your name,’ Paul said, and he called up the subtleties of Voice: ‘Tell me your name!’ "

42.0,205,text_content,"Still using the Voice, Paul said: ‘Submit, Captain.’ "
42.0,206,text_content,chest. The attacker hit the floor in a sodden heap with the knife still in him. 
42.0,207,text_content,"The captain faced his sole remaining companion. ‘I decide what best serves His Majesty,’ he said. ‘Understood?’ "
42.0,208,text_content,The other Sardaukar’s shoulders slumped. 
42.0,209,text_content,"‘Drop your weapon,’ the captain said. "
42.0,210,text_content,The Sardaukar obeyed. 
42.0,211,text_content,"The captain returned his attention to Paul. ‘I have killed a friend for you,’ he said. ‘Let us always remember that.’ "
42.0,212,text_content,"‘You’re my prisoners,’ Paul said. ‘You submitted to me. Whether you live or die is of no importance.’ He motioned to his guard to take the two Sardaukar, signaled the lieutenant who had searched the prisoners. "
42.0,213,text_content,"The guard moved in, hustled the Sardaukar away. "
42.0,214,text_content,Paul bent toward his lieutenant. 
42.0,215,text_content,"‘Muad’Dib,’ the man said, ‘I failed you in …’ "
42.0,216,text_content,you haven’t discovered everything.’ 
42.0,217,text_content,"He looked up at Gurney, who had moved close to listen. "
42.0,218,text_content,"‘Then we best kill them,’ the lieutenant said. "
42.0,219,text_content,"Paul shook his head, still looking at Gurney. ‘No. I want them to escape.’ "
42.0,220,text_content,Gurney stared at him. ‘Sire …’he breathed. 
42.0,221,text_content,‘Yes?’ 
42.0,222,text_content,the Emperor learns that he’ll not rest until he has you over a slow fire.’ 
42.0,223,text_content,around Rabban?’ 
42.0,224,text_content,"Gurney straightened, eyes narrowed. ‘Your question makes no …’ "
42.0,225,text_content,‘Are there?’ Paul barked. 
42.0,226,text_content,else do you think we ventured this far into …’ 
42.0,227,text_content,"‘It is the most precious thing in the universe,’ Paul said. ‘To them.’ He looked toward Stilgar and Chani who now were crossing the chamber toward him. ‘And we control it, Gurney.’ "
42.0,228,text_content,‘The Harkonnens control it!’ Gurney protested. 
42.0,229,text_content,"nodded to Stilgar who stopped in front of Paul, Chani beside him. "
42.0,230,text_content,‘Could you draw my life’s blood with that knife?’ 
42.0,231,text_content,"‘For the good of the tribe,’ Stilgar growled. "
42.0,232,text_content,"‘Then use that knife,’ Paul said. "
42.0,233,text_content,‘Are you calling me out?’ Stilgar demanded. 
42.0,234,text_content,"‘If I do,’ Paul said, ‘I shall stand there without weapon and let you slay me.’ "
42.0,235,text_content,"Stilgar drew in a quick, sharp breath. "

42.0,237,text_content,"here, you were not in the front of battle. Your first thought was to protect Chani.’ "
42.0,238,text_content,"‘She’s my niece,’ Stilgar said. ‘If there’d been any doubt of your Fedaykin handling those scum …’ "
42.0,239,text_content,‘Why was your first thought of Chani?’ Paul demanded. 
42.0,240,text_content,‘It wasn’t!’ 
42.0,241,text_content,‘Oh?’ 
42.0,242,text_content,"‘It was of you,’ Stilgar admitted. "
42.0,243,text_content,‘Do you think you could lift your hand against me?’ Paul asked. 
42.0,244,text_content,"Stilgar began to tremble. ‘It’s the way,’ he muttered. "
42.0,245,text_content,"you permitted two such to live one night, my mother and myself.’ "
42.0,246,text_content,"As Stilgar remained silent, trembling, staring at him, Paul said: ‘Ways change, Stil. You have changed them yourself.’ "
42.0,247,text_content,Stilgar looked down at the yellow emblem on the knife he held. 
42.0,248,text_content,with the internal problems of every family?’ 
42.0,249,text_content,Stilgar continued staring at the knife. 
42.0,250,text_content,‘Do you think I wish to cut off my right arm?’ Paul demanded. 
42.0,251,text_content,"Slowly, Stilgar looked up at him. "
42.0,252,text_content,‘You!’ Paul said. ‘Do you think I wish to deprive myself or the tribe of your wisdom and strength?’ 
42.0,253,text_content,"floor, Shai-hulud willing. The Lisan al-Gaib, him I could not harm. You knew this when you handed me this knife.’ "
42.0,254,text_content,"‘I knew it,’ Paul agreed. "
42.0,255,text_content,"Stilgar opened his hand. The knife clattered against the stone of the floor. ‘Ways change,’ he said. "
42.0,256,text_content,"‘Chani,’ Paul said, ‘go to my mother, send her here that her counsel will be available in—’ "
42.0,257,text_content,‘But you said we would go to the south!’ she protested. 
42.0,258,text_content,"‘I was wrong,’ he said. ‘The Harkonnens are not there. The war is not there.’ "
42.0,259,text_content,"She took a deep breath, accepting this as a desert woman accepted all necessities in the midst of a life involved with death. "
42.0,260,text_content,but a way must be found to make the young men accept this without combat.’ 
42.0,261,text_content,Chani glanced at Stilgar.

42.0,263,text_content,"‘I shall return with your mother,’ Chani said. "
42.0,264,text_content,"‘Send her,’ Paul said. ‘Stilgar’s instinct was right. I am stronger when you are safe. You will remain in the sietch.’ "
42.0,265,text_content,"She started to protest, swallowed it. "
42.0,266,text_content,"‘Sihaya,’ Paul said, using his intimate name for her. He whirled away to the right, met Gurney’s glaring eyes. "
42.0,267,text_content,The interchange between Paul and the older Fremen had passed as though in a cloud around Gurney since Paul’s reference to his mother. 
42.0,268,text_content,"‘Your mother,’ Gurney said. "
42.0,269,text_content,"‘Idaho saved us the night of the raid,’ Paul said, distracted by the parting with Chani. ‘Right now we’ve—’ "
42.0,270,text_content,"‘What of Duncan Idaho, m’Lord?’ Gurney asked. "
42.0,271,text_content,‘He’s dead – buying us a bit of time to escape.’

43.0,9,text_content,"‘We must not lose that man,’ Jessica thought. ‘Paul’s plan must work. Anything else would be highest tragedy.’ "

43.0,13,text_content,Paul looked at her. 
43.0,14,text_content,"‘It’s time,’ she said, and passed the message cylinder to him. "
43.0,15,text_content,Now’s the time for sure. They’ll think you a coward if you—’ 
43.0,16,text_content,‘Who dares call me coward?’ Paul demanded. His hand flashed to his crysknife hilt. 
43.0,17,text_content,"Bated silence came over the group, spreading out into the crowd. "
43.0,18,text_content,leaped lightly up to it and faced the people.

43.0,26,text_content,"they could respond, Paul hurled his voice at them in anger: ‘Do you think the Lisan al-Gaib that stupid?’ "
43.0,27,text_content,There was stunned silence. 
43.0,28,text_content,"‘He’s accepting the religious mantle,’ Jessica thought. ‘He must not do it!’ "
43.0,29,text_content,‘It’s the way!’ someone shouted. 
43.0,30,text_content,"Paul spoke dryly, probing the emotional undercurrents. ‘Ways change.’ "
43.0,31,text_content,An angry voice lifted from a corner of the cavern: ‘We’ll say what’s to change!’ 
43.0,32,text_content,There were scattered shouts of agreement through the throng. 
43.0,33,text_content,"‘As you wish,’ Paul said. "
43.0,34,text_content,And Jessica heard the subtle intonations as he used the powers of Voice she had taught him. 
43.0,35,text_content,"‘You will say,’ he agreed. ‘But first you will hear my say.’ "

43.0,37,text_content,"‘The good of the tribe, that is the most important thing, eh?’ Paul asked. "
43.0,38,text_content,"Still with that flat-voiced dignity, Stilgar said: ‘Thus our steps are guided.’ "
43.0,39,text_content,instructors we’ve trained in the weirding way?’

43.0,41,text_content,"on occasion, and the sages, the wisest of the wise, listen to me and honor me in Council.’ "
43.0,42,text_content,There was shuffling silence among the crowd.

43.0,46,text_content,"‘No man recognizes leadership without the challenge and the combat, eh?’ Paul asked. "

43.0,48,text_content,our families in happiness amidst an abundance of water – is this our goal?’ 
43.0,49,text_content,"‘Hard tasks need hard ways,’ someone shouted. "
43.0,50,text_content,"it, so do you all.’ "
43.0,51,text_content,"Again, the angry mutters lifted from the crowd. "

43.0,53,text_content,"‘He’s using the Voice well,’ Jessica thought, ‘but that’s not enough with these people. They’ve good insulation against vocal control. He must catch them also with logic.’ "

43.0,55,text_content,Stilgar moved up beside Paul. 
43.0,56,text_content,‘How many of you see what this means?’ Paul asked. ‘Stilgar saw it immediately.’

43.0,61,text_content,whether the Emperor says yea or nay! He gave it to my father and it comes to me through my father!’ 
43.0,62,text_content,"Paul lifted himself onto his toes, settled back to his heels. He studied the crowd, feeling their temper. "
43.0,63,text_content,"‘Almost,’ he thought. "
43.0,64,text_content,just to provide you with a circus?’ 
43.0,65,text_content,by leaving every Fremen tribe in the erg without a leader?’ 
43.0,66,text_content,"Beside Paul, Stilgar stirred, looked at him questioningly. "
43.0,67,text_content,stopped killing off our best men and started killing our real enemies – the Harkonnens!’ 
43.0,68,text_content,he shouted. 
43.0,69,text_content,Muad’Dib! Ya hya chouhada!’ 
43.0,70,text_content,Jessica translated it to herself: ‘‘Long live the fighters of Muad’Dib!’’ The scene she and Paul and Stilgar had cooked up between them had worked as they’d planned. 
43.0,71,text_content,The tumult died slowly. 
43.0,72,text_content,"When silence was restored, Paul faced Stilgar, said: ‘Kneel, Stilgar.’ "
43.0,73,text_content,Stilgar dropped to his knees on the ledge. 
43.0,74,text_content,"‘Hand me your crysknife,’ Paul said. "
43.0,75,text_content,Stilgar obeyed. 
43.0,76,text_content,"‘This was not as we planned it,’ Jessica thought. "
43.0,77,text_content,"‘I, Stilgar, take this knife from the hands of my Duke.’ "
43.0,78,text_content,"‘I, Stilgar, take this knife from the hands of my Duke,’ Stilgar said, and accepted the milky blade from Paul. "
43.0,79,text_content,Dune 
43.0,80,text_content,"Stilgar repeated the words, speaking slowly and solemnly. "
43.0,81,text_content,"Remembering the source of the rite, Jessica blinked back tears, shook her head. ‘I know the reasons for this,’ she thought. ‘I shouldn’t let it stir me.’ "
43.0,82,text_content,"‘I dedicate this blade to the cause of my Duke and the death of his enemies for as long as our blood shall flow,’ Paul said. "
43.0,83,text_content,Stilgar repeated it after him.

43.0,86,text_content,"the way and a Reverend Mother shall see it.’ And, from farther away: ‘She shows us through her son!’ "
43.0,87,text_content,I told you.’ 
43.0,88,text_content,"‘Wise,’ Jessica thought. ‘The tribal commander must lose no face among those who should obey him.’ "

43.0,92,text_content,"Feeling the emotions of the throng, Jessica sensed the fighting edge of these people. They could not be more ready. ‘We are taking them at the crest,’ she thought. "
43.0,93,text_content,"In the inner chamber, Paul motioned his mother to be seated, said: ‘Wait here.’ And he ducked through the hangings to the side passage. "

43.0,102,text_content,"A cough sounded outside the chamber hangings. Jessica straightened, took a deep breath, exhaled slowly. "
43.0,103,text_content,"‘Enter,’ she said. "
43.0,104,text_content,"odd grimace, then he was behind her, lifting her to her feet with one brawny arm beneath her chin. "
43.0,105,text_content,"‘Gurney, you fool, what are you doing?’ she demanded. "
43.0,106,text_content,wary of every trick of death and violence. Here was an instrument she herself had helped train with subtle hints and suggestions. 
43.0,107,text_content,the curtains parted and Paul entered. 
43.0,108,text_content,"‘Here he is, Moth—’ Paul broke off, taking in the tensions of the scene. "
43.0,109,text_content,"‘You will stand where you are, m’Lord,’ Gurney said. "
43.0,110,text_content,‘What …’ Paul shook his head. 
43.0,111,text_content,"Jessica started to speak, felt the arm tighten against her throat. "
43.0,112,text_content,"more seconds of life. And I assure you, these are all you have.’ "
43.0,113,text_content,"Paul took a step forward, ‘Gurney, man, what is—’ "
43.0,114,text_content,‘Stop right where you are!’ Gurney snapped. ‘One more step and she’s dead.’ 
43.0,115,text_content,"Paul’s hand slipped to his knife hilt. He spoke in deadly quiet: ‘You had best explain yourself, Gurney.’ "
43.0,116,text_content,betrayer under my knife. No one can stop me from—’ 
43.0,117,text_content,"‘You couldn’t be more wrong, Gurney,’ Paul said. "
43.0,118,text_content,And Jessica thought: ‘So that’s it! What irony!’ 
43.0,119,text_content,and cheated to confirm this charge. I’ve even pushed semuta on a Harkonnen guard captain to get part of the story.’ 
43.0,120,text_content,front of him. ‘… I’ll have your blood.’ 
43.0,121,text_content,"Yueh was a conditioned medic, fit for a royal house,’ Gurney snarled. ‘He could not turn traitor!’ "
43.0,122,text_content,"‘I know a way to remove that conditioning,’ Paul said. "
43.0,123,text_content,"‘Evidence,’ Gurney insisted. "
43.0,124,text_content,"‘The evidence is not here,’ Paul said. ‘It’s in Tabr sietch, far to the south, but if—’ "
43.0,125,text_content,"‘This is a trick,’ Gurney snarled, and his arm tightened on Jessica’s throat. "
43.0,126,text_content,"‘No trick, Gurney,’ Paul said, and his voice carried such a note of terrible sadness that the sound tore at Jessica’s heart. "
43.0,127,text_content,"‘I saw the message captured from the Harkonnen agent,’ Gurney said. ‘The note pointed directly at—’ "
43.0,128,text_content,making him suspect the woman he loved.’ 
43.0,129,text_content,‘Ayah!’ Gurney said. ‘You’ve not—’ 
43.0,130,text_content,voice. 
43.0,131,text_content,"‘He has the Great Control,’ she thought. "
43.0,132,text_content,Gurney’s arm trembled against her neck. The point of the knife at her back moved with uncertainty.

43.0,138,text_content,"Hearing her son, Jessica marveled at the awareness in him, the penetrating insight of his intelligence. "
43.0,139,text_content,knows this. I’ve given her my father’s message that he never distrusted her.’ 
43.0,140,text_content,her throat had ceased its trembling; the knife point at her back pressed still and sharp. 
43.0,141,text_content,"‘One of the most terrible moments in a boy’s life,’ Paul said, "
43.0,142,text_content,"an awakening to the fact that the world is ‘there’ and ‘here’ and we are in it alone. The moment carries its own truth; you can’t evade it. I ‘heard’ my father when he spoke of my mother. She’s not the betrayer, Gurney.’ "
43.0,143,text_content,"but Gurney’s hand fell away. She crossed to Paul, stood in front of him, not touching him. "
43.0,144,text_content,your own course. I …’ 
43.0,145,text_content,"She broke off, stopped by the low sound of muttering behind her. "
43.0,146,text_content,‘Gurney!’ 
43.0,147,text_content,"She saw Paul’s eyes directed beyond her, turned. "
43.0,148,text_content,"of an issue stillsuit, the type the smugglers traded for among the sietch warrens. "
43.0,149,text_content,I’ve betrayed my own Duke! The finest—’ 
43.0,150,text_content,‘Be still!’ Paul said. 
43.0,151,text_content,Gurney stared at him. 
43.0,152,text_content,"‘Close that robe and stop acting like a fool,’ Paul said. ‘I’ve had enough foolishness for one day.’ "
43.0,153,text_content,"‘Kill me, I say!’ Gurney raged. "
43.0,154,text_content,man I need?’ 
43.0,155,text_content,"Gurney looked at Jessica, spoke in a forlorn, pleading note so unlike him: ‘Then you, my Lady, please … you kill me.’ "
43.0,156,text_content,"Gently, she pulled the spread robe out of his fingers, closed and fastened the fabric over his chest. "
43.0,157,text_content,Gurney spoke brokenly: ‘But … I …’ 
43.0,158,text_content,"‘You thought you were doing a thing for Leto,’ she said, ‘and for this I honor you.’ "
43.0,159,text_content,"‘My Lady,’ Gurney said. He dropped his chin to his chest, squeezed his eyelids closed against the tears. "
43.0,160,text_content,in her voice. ‘It’s over and we can be thankful we’ll never again have that sort of misunderstanding between us.’

43.0,163,text_content,about—’

43.0,165,text_content,"‘I … I’ll get my baliset,’ Gurney said. ‘It’s in the passage.’ He stepped around them and through the hangings. "
43.0,166,text_content,"Paul put a hand on his mother’s arm, found that she was trembling. "
43.0,167,text_content,"‘It’s over, Mother,’ he said. "
43.0,168,text_content,"Without turning her head, she looked up at him from the corners of her eyes. ‘Over?’ "
43.0,169,text_content,‘Of course. Gurney’s …’

44.0,8,text_content,out onto the desert for only a moment.

44.0,12,text_content,tremble. 
44.0,13,text_content,"Otheym pressed palms together, said: ‘I have brought Chani.’ He bowed, retreated through the hangings. "
44.0,14,text_content,And Jessica thought: ‘How do I tell Chani?’ 
44.0,15,text_content,‘How is my grandson?’Jessica asked. 
44.0,16,text_content,"‘So it’s to be the ritual greeting,’ Chani thought, and her fears returned. ‘Where is Muad’Dib? Why isn’t he here to greet me?’ "
44.0,17,text_content,"‘He is healthy and happy, my mother,’ Chani said. ‘I left him with Alia in the care of Harah.’ "
44.0,18,text_content,"‘My mother,’ Jessica thought. ‘Yes, she has the right to call me that in the formal greeting. She has given me a grandson.’ "
44.0,19,text_content,"‘I hear a gift of cloth has been sent from Coanua sietch,’ Jessica said. "
44.0,20,text_content,"‘It is lovely cloth,’ Chani said. "
44.0,21,text_content,‘Does Alia send a message?’ 
44.0,22,text_content,‘No message. But the sietch moves more smoothly now that the people are beginning to accept the miracle of her status.’ 
44.0,23,text_content,"‘Why does she drag this out so?’ Chani wondered. ‘Something was so urgent that they sent a ’thopter for me. Now, we drag through the formalities!’ "
44.0,24,text_content,"‘We must have some of the new cloth cut into garments for little Leto,’Jessica said. "
44.0,25,text_content,that Jessica might not see the betrayal – that this was a question about Paul-Muad’Dib. 
44.0,26,text_content,know he does it out of fear of us.’ 
44.0,27,text_content,is too frozen. Why is she so still? What has happened to my Usul?’ 
44.0,28,text_content,whole land may blossom thus?’ 
44.0,29,text_content,"‘The land is beautiful, true,’ Chani said. ‘But there is much grief in it.’ "
44.0,30,text_content,"‘Grief is the price of victory,’Jessica said. "
44.0,31,text_content,summoned north.’ 
44.0,32,text_content,"‘I summoned you,’Jessica said. "
44.0,33,text_content,her voice even: ‘The message was signed Muad’Dib.’ 
44.0,34,text_content,one we need now.’ 
44.0,35,text_content,Only the slightest tone of resignation crept into Chani’s voice as she said: ‘Now you may say the thing that must be said.’ 
44.0,36,text_content,"‘You were needed here to help me revive Paul,’ Jessica said. And she thought: ‘There! I said it in the precisely correct way.’ Revive. ‘Thus she knows Paul is alive and knows there is peril, all in the same word.’ "
44.0,37,text_content,‘‘Take me to him!’’ But she waited silently for the answer. 
44.0,38,text_content,that seems to fit. A most unusual poison. I’ve examined his blood in the most subtle ways without detecting it.’ 
44.0,39,text_content,Chani thrust herself forward onto her knees. ‘Poison? Is he in pain? Could I …’ 
44.0,40,text_content,eye.’ 
44.0,41,text_content,may do that you cannot do?’ 
44.0,42,text_content,"‘She is brave, lovely and, ah-h-h, so perceptive,’ Jessica thought. ‘She’d have made a fine Bene Gesserit.’ "
44.0,43,text_content,… a basic intuition. The thought came unbidden: “Send for Chani.”’ 
44.0,44,text_content,"For the first time, Chani saw the sadness in Jessica’s expression, the unveiled pain modifying the inward stare. "
44.0,45,text_content,"‘I’ve done all I know to do,’Jessica said. ‘That ‘all…’ it is so far beyond what is usually supposed as ‘all’ that you would find difficulty imagining it. Yet … I failed.’ "
44.0,46,text_content,"‘The old companion, Halleck,’ Chani asked, ‘is it possible he’s a traitor?’ "
44.0,47,text_content,"‘Not Gurney,’ Jessica said. "
44.0,48,text_content,into this flat denial.

44.0,50,text_content,"waxen, rigid. There was no visible movement to him. "
44.0,51,text_content,so that Chani reached out and clasped Jessica’s hand. The answering grip was painful in its intensity. 
44.0,52,text_content,and I do not want to give up his water to the tribe.’ 
44.0,53,text_content,"‘How long has he been this way?’ Chani asked. She disengaged her hand from Jessica’s, moved farther into the room. "
44.0,54,text_content,"tongue, watching Chani cross to Paul. "
44.0,55,text_content,"the strong nose, the shuttered eyes – the features so peaceful in this rigid repose. "
44.0,56,text_content,‘How does he take nourishment?’ Chani asked. 
44.0,57,text_content,"‘The demands of his flesh are so slight he does not yet need food,’Jessica said. "
44.0,58,text_content,‘How many know of what has happened?’ Chani asked. 
44.0,59,text_content,"‘Only his closest advisers, a few of the leaders, the Fedaykin and, of course, whoever administered the poison.’ "
44.0,60,text_content,‘There is no clue to the poisoner?’ 
44.0,61,text_content,"‘And it’s not for want of investigating,’Jessica said. "
44.0,62,text_content,‘What do the Fedaykin say?’ Chani asked. 
44.0,63,text_content,"‘They believe Paul is in a sacred trance, gathering his holy powers before the final battles. This is a thought I’ve cultivated.’ "
44.0,64,text_content,"about his face … but it was only the spice, the ubiquitous spice whose odor permeated everything in Fremen life. Still … "
44.0,65,text_content,against too much spice in his diet?’ 
44.0,66,text_content,"‘Allergy reactions are all negative,’Jessica said. "
44.0,67,text_content,"She closed her eyes, as much to blot out this scene as because of sudden realization of fatigue. ‘How long have I been without sleep?’ she asked herself. ‘Too long.’ "
44.0,68,text_content,to test his blood?’ 
44.0,69,text_content,"‘Normal Fremen blood,’Jessica said. ‘Completely adapted to the diet and the life here.’ "
44.0,70,text_content,from watching the Reverend Mothers. Time could be made to serve the mind. One concentrated the entire attention. 
44.0,71,text_content,"Presently, Chani said: ‘Is there a maker here?’ "
44.0,72,text_content,"‘There are several,’Jessica said with a touch of weariness. ‘We are never without them these days. Each victory requires its blessing. Each ceremony before a raid—’ "
44.0,73,text_content,"‘But Paul-Muad’Dib has held himself aloof from these ceremonies,’ Chani said. "
44.0,74,text_content,precipitated. 
44.0,75,text_content,‘How did you know this?’Jessica asked. 
44.0,76,text_content,‘It is spoken.’ 
44.0,77,text_content,"‘Too much is spoken,’Jessica said bitterly. "
44.0,78,text_content,"‘Get me the raw Water of the maker,’ Chani said. "
44.0,79,text_content,said: ‘At once.’ She went out through the hanging to send a waterman. 
44.0,80,text_content,"Chani sat staring at Paul. ‘If he has tried to do this,’ she thought. ‘And it’s the sort of thing he might try …’ "
44.0,81,text_content,"dipped a finger in the fluid, held the finger close to Paul’s nose. "
44.0,82,text_content,"The skin along the bridge of his nose wrinkled slightly. Slowly, the nostrils flared. "
44.0,83,text_content,Jessica gasped. 
44.0,84,text_content,Chani touched the dampened finger to Paul’s upper lip. 
44.0,85,text_content,"He drew in a long, sobbing breath. "
44.0,86,text_content,‘What is this?’Jessica demanded. 
44.0,87,text_content,"‘Be still,’ Chani said. ‘You must convert a small amount of the sacred water. Quickly!’ "
44.0,88,text_content,drew in a small sip. 
44.0,89,text_content,Paul’s eyes flew open. He stared upward at Chani. 
44.0,90,text_content,"‘It is not necessary for her to change the Water,’ he said. His voice was weak, but steady. "
44.0,91,text_content,"Jessica, a sip of the fluid on her tongue, found her body rallying, converting the poison almost automatically. In the light elevation the ceremony always imparted, she sensed the life-glow from Paul – a radiation there registering on her senses. "
44.0,92,text_content,"In that instant, she knew. "
44.0,93,text_content,‘You drank the sacred water!’ she blurted. 
44.0,94,text_content,"‘One drop of it,’ Paul said. ‘So small … one drop.’ "
44.0,95,text_content,‘How could you do such a foolish thing?’ she demanded. 
44.0,96,text_content,"‘He is your son,’ Chani said. "
44.0,97,text_content,Jessica glared at her. 
44.0,98,text_content,knows.’ 
44.0,99,text_content,"‘A thing that others can do, he must do,’ Chani said. "
44.0,100,text_content,How did you get here? You’re supposed to be … Why are you here?’ 
44.0,101,text_content,He tried to push himself onto his elbows. Chani pressed him back gently. 
44.0,102,text_content,"‘Please, my Usul,’ she said. "
44.0,103,text_content,"‘I feel so weak,’ he said. His gaze darted around the room. ‘How long have I been here?’ "
44.0,104,text_content,"‘You’ve been three weeks in a coma so deep that the spark of life seemed to have fled,’Jessica said. "
44.0,105,text_content,‘But it was … I took it just a moment ago and …’ 
44.0,106,text_content,"‘A moment for you, three weeks of fear for me,’Jessica said. "
44.0,107,text_content,swallowed the palm-cupped liquid. 
44.0,108,text_content,‘Paul!’Jessica screamed. 
44.0,109,text_content,"He grabbed her hand, faced her with a death’s head grin, and he sent his awareness surging over her. "
44.0,110,text_content,"of the entire being. It shook her, weakened her, and she cowered in her mind, fearful of him. "
44.0,111,text_content,me.’ 
44.0,112,text_content,"She shook her head, terrified by the very thought. "
44.0,113,text_content,‘Show it to me!’ he commanded. 
44.0,114,text_content,‘No!’ 
44.0,115,text_content,"But she could not escape him. Bludgeoned by the terrible force of him, she closed her eyes and focused inward – the-direction-that-is-dark. "
44.0,116,text_content,"and around the lights, driven by darkness and a wind out of nowhere. "
44.0,117,text_content,have fallen had not Chani jumped to support her. 
44.0,118,text_content,‘Reverend Mother!’ Chani said. ‘What is wrong?’ 
44.0,119,text_content,"‘Tired,’Jessica whispered. ‘So … tired.’ "
44.0,120,text_content,"‘Here,’ Chani said. ‘Sit here.’ She helped Jessica to a cushion against the wall. "
44.0,121,text_content,The strong young arms felt so good to Jessica. She clung to Chani. 
44.0,122,text_content,"‘He has, in truth, seen the Water of Life?’ Chani asked. She disengaged herself from Jessica’s grip. "
44.0,123,text_content,weeks on a heaving sea. She sensed the old Reverend Mother within her … and all the others awakened and questioning: ‘‘What was that? What happened? Where was that place?’’ 
44.0,124,text_content,was the fact out of the Bene Gesserit dream. And the fact gave her no peace. 
44.0,125,text_content,‘What happened?’ Chani demanded. 
44.0,126,text_content,Jessica shook her head. 
44.0,127,text_content,"force without changing into something other than man. For a woman, the situation is reversed.’ "
44.0,128,text_content,"Jessica looked up, found Chani was staring at her while listening to Paul. "
44.0,129,text_content,"‘Do you understand me, Mother?’ Paul asked. "
44.0,130,text_content,She could only nod. 
44.0,131,text_content,as by taking.’ 
44.0,132,text_content,"‘And you, my son,’ Jessica asked, ‘are you one who gives or one who takes?’ "
44.0,133,text_content,his right. 
44.0,134,text_content,"Chani felt a draft against her cheek, turned to see the hangings close. "
44.0,135,text_content,"‘It was Otheym,’ Paul said. ‘He was listening.’ "
44.0,136,text_content,He is indeed the Lisan al-Gaib. 
44.0,137,text_content,"‘You have seen the future, Paul,’ Jessica said. ‘Will you say what you’ve seen?’ "
44.0,138,text_content,help him. ‘The space above Arrakis is filled with the ships of the Guild.’ Jessica trembled at the certainty in his voice. 
44.0,139,text_content,with every conscript he could muster. Every Great House has its raiders above us … waiting.’ 
44.0,140,text_content,filled her with awe. 
44.0,141,text_content,"Jessica tried to swallow in a dry throat, said: ‘For what are they waiting?’ "
44.0,142,text_content,Paul looked at her. ‘For the Guild’s permission to land. The Guild will strand on Arrakis any force that lands without permission.’ 
44.0,143,text_content,‘The Guild’s protecting us?’Jessica asked. 
44.0,144,text_content,to a point where even the poorest Houses are up there now waiting to loot us.’ 
44.0,145,text_content,she’d seen in him the night he’d revealed the path of the future that’d taken them among the Fremen. 
44.0,146,text_content,"a scout force sent out … to find a pre-spice mass. If we plant a quantity of the Water of Life above a pre-spice mass, do you know what will happen?’ "
44.0,147,text_content,"Jessica weighed his words, suddenly saw through to his meaning. ‘Paul!’ she gasped. "
44.0,148,text_content,spice or maker.’ 
44.0,149,text_content,"Chani put a hand to her mouth, shocked to numb silence by the blasphemy pouring from Paul’s lips. "
44.0,150,text_content,"‘He who can destroy a thing has the real control of it,’ Paul said. ‘We can destroy the spice.’ "
44.0,151,text_content,‘What stays the Guild’s hand?’Jessica whispered. 
44.0,152,text_content,know I have their secret here!’ Paul held out his cupped hand. ‘Without the spice they’re blind!’ 
44.0,153,text_content,Chani found her voice. ‘You said you see the ‘now!’ 
44.0,154,text_content,began to fade. 
44.0,155,text_content,to lose what they must have. But now they’re desperate. All paths lead into darkness.’ 
45.0,1,opening_text,And that day dawned when Arrakis lay at the hub of the universe with the wheel poised to spin. 
45.0,2,opening_caption,—from ‘Arrakis Awakening’ by the Princess Irulan 
45.0,3,text_content,‘Will you look at that thing!’ Stilgar whispered. 
45.0,4,text_content,the city of Arrakeen lay cold and gleaming in the light of the northern sun. 
45.0,5,text_content,Emperor Shaddam IV. 
45.0,6,text_content,in there.’ 
45.0,7,text_content,"‘Five legions,’ Paul said. "
45.0,8,text_content,"‘It grows light,’ Stilgar hissed. ‘We like it not, your exposing yourself, Muad’Dib. Let us go back into the rocks now.’ "
45.0,9,text_content,"‘I’m perfectly safe here,’ Paul said. "
45.0,10,text_content,"‘That ship mounts projectile weapons,’ Gurney said. "
45.0,11,text_content,"‘They believe us protected by shields,’ Paul said. ‘They wouldn’t waste a shot on an unidentified trio even if they saw us.’ "
45.0,12,text_content,source like stalks severed from a plant and left to wither. Only this basin and its city remained to the enemy. 
45.0,13,text_content,"‘They might try a sortie by ’thopter,’ Stilgar said. ‘If they see us.’ "
45.0,14,text_content,"‘Let them,’ Paul said. ‘We’ve ’thopters to burn today … and we know a storm is coming.’ "
45.0,15,text_content,a tent. 
45.0,16,text_content,‘Is there anything new to see from here?’ Gurney asked. ‘We should be getting under cover. The storm ‘is’ coming.’ 
45.0,17,text_content,"Ah-h-h, my dear Emperor, how confident you are.’ "
45.0,18,text_content,"‘Men are coming up the secret way,’ Stilgar said. ‘It may be Otheym and Korba returning.’ "
45.0,19,text_content,"‘All right, Stil,’ Paul said. ‘We’ll go back.’ "

45.0,22,text_content,"Two men emerged from the hole by the communications equipment, spoke to the guards there. "
45.0,23,text_content,"Paul glanced at Stilgar, nodded in the direction of the two men. ‘Get their report, Stil.’ "
45.0,24,text_content,Stilgar moved to obey. 
45.0,25,text_content,"that dark hole in the rock, thought about the long climb down that narrow man-made tunnel to the floor of the basin. "
45.0,26,text_content,Stilgar crossed to Paul. 
45.0,27,text_content,‘What was so important that they couldn’t send a cielago with the message?’ Paul asked. 
45.0,28,text_content,"with a tight beam, it is wrong to use those things, Muad’Dib. They can find you by taking a bearing on its emission.’ "
45.0,29,text_content,"‘They’ll soon be too busy to find me,’ Paul said. ‘What did the men report?’ "
45.0,30,text_content,and other projectile weapons are in place. The people are deployed as you ordered. It was all routine.’ 
45.0,31,text_content,creeping like an insect working its way across an exposed rock. 
45.0,32,text_content,"‘It’ll take our Sardaukar a little time afoot before they can signal a troop carrier,’ Paul said. ‘They are being watched?’ "
45.0,33,text_content,"‘They are being watched,’ Stilgar said. "
45.0,34,text_content,"Beside Paul, Gurney Halleck cleared his throat. ‘Hadn’t we best be getting to a place of safety?’ "
45.0,35,text_content,"‘There is no such place,’ Paul said. ‘Is the weather report still favorable?’ "
45.0,36,text_content,"‘A great grandmother of a storm coming,’ Stilgar said. ‘Can you not feel it, Muad’Dib?’ "
45.0,37,text_content,"‘The air does feel chancy,’ Paul agreed. ‘But I like the certainty of poling the weather.’ "
45.0,38,text_content,report on the weather from their friends in space.’ 
45.0,39,text_content,‘Any more probing sorties?’ Paul asked. 
45.0,40,text_content,"‘Nothing since the landing last night,’ Stilgar said. ‘They know we’re here. I think now they wait to choose their own time.’ "
45.0,41,text_content,"‘We choose the time,’ Paul said. "
45.0,42,text_content,"Gurney glanced upward, growled: ‘If ‘they’ let us.’ "
45.0,43,text_content,"‘That fleet’ll stay in space,’ Paul said. "
45.0,44,text_content,Gurney shook his head. 
45.0,45,text_content,"‘They have no choice,’ Paul said. ‘We can destroy the spice. The Guild dares not risk that.’ "
45.0,46,text_content,"‘Desperate people are the most dangerous,’ Gurney said. "
45.0,47,text_content,‘Are we not desperate?’ Stilgar asked. 
45.0,48,text_content,Gurney scowled at him. 
45.0,49,text_content,of waiting we’ve added before Arrakis can bloom. He’s not—’ 
45.0,50,text_content,"‘Arrrgh,’ Gurney growled. "
45.0,51,text_content,‘Why’s he so gloomy?’ Stilgar asked. 
45.0,52,text_content,"‘He’s always gloomy before a battle,’ Paul said. ‘It’s the only form of good humor Gurney allows himself "
45.0,53,text_content,"me much to think on all the poor Harkonnen souls we’ll dispatch unshriven,’ he said. "
45.0,54,text_content,Stilgar chuckled. ‘He talks like a Fedaykin.’ 
45.0,55,text_content,"‘Gurney was born a death commando,’ Paul said. And he thought: ‘Yes, let them occupy their minds with small talk before we test ourselves against that force on the plain.’ He looked to the gap in the rock wall and back to Gurney, found that the troubadour-warrior had resumed a brooding scowl. "
45.0,56,text_content,"‘Worry saps the strength,’ Paul murmured. ‘You told me that once, Gurney.’ "
45.0,57,text_content,"‘My Duke,’ Gurney said, ‘my chief worry is the atomics. If you use them to blast a hole in the Shield Wall …’ "
45.0,58,text_content,risk our destroying the source of the spice.’ 
45.0,59,text_content,‘But the injunction against—’ 
45.0,60,text_content,"We’re going to blast the Shield Wall, not humans.’ "
45.0,61,text_content,"‘It’s too fine a point,’ Gurney said. "
45.0,62,text_content,"‘The hair-splitters up there will welcome any point,’ Paul said. ‘Let’s talk no more about it.’ "
45.0,63,text_content,yet?’ 
45.0,64,text_content,"‘Yes,’ Stilgar muttered. "
45.0,65,text_content,Paul looked at him. ‘What’s eating you?’ 
45.0,66,text_content,"‘I never knew the city man could be trusted completely,’ Stilgar said. "
45.0,67,text_content,"‘I was a city man myself once,’ Paul said. "
45.0,68,text_content,Stilgar stiffened. His face grew dark with blood. ‘Muad’Dib knows I did not mean—’ 
45.0,69,text_content,people have Fremen blood. It’s just that they haven’t yet learned how to escape their bondage. We’ll teach them.’ 
45.0,70,text_content,men of the communities.’ 
45.0,71,text_content,by the Sardaukar?’ 
45.0,72,text_content,"‘An old trick, my Duke. They thought to burden us with refugees.’ "
45.0,73,text_content,"for us, Stilgar.’ "
45.0,74,text_content,"‘The city people do seem eager,’ Stilgar said. "
45.0,75,text_content,"‘Their hate is fresh and clear,’ Paul said. ‘That’s why we use them as shock troops.’ "
45.0,76,text_content,"‘The slaughter among them will be fearful,’ Gurney said. "
45.0,77,text_content,Stilgar nodded agreement. 
45.0,78,text_content,"‘They were told the odds,’ Paul said. ‘They know every Sardaukar they kill will be one less for us. You see, gentlemen, they have something to die for. They’ve discovered they’re a people. They’re awakening.’ "
45.0,79,text_content,"A muttered exclamation came from the watcher at the telescope. Paul moved to the rock slit, asked: ‘What is it out there?’ "
45.0,80,text_content,it was like a hawk into a nest of rock partridge.’ 
45.0,81,text_content,"‘Our captive Sardaukar have arrived,’ Paul said. "
45.0,82,text_content,storage yard where they kept the spice.’ 
45.0,83,text_content,yet lives!’ 
45.0,84,text_content,Paul spoke to the Fedaykin at the telescope. ‘Watch the flagpole atop the Emperor’s ship. If my flag is raised there—’ 
45.0,85,text_content,"‘It will not be,’ Gurney said. "
45.0,86,text_content,us settle the issue between ourselves.’ 
45.0,87,text_content,"‘I’ve no experience with these offworld things,’ Stilgar said. ‘I’ve heard of them, but it seems unlikely the—’ "
45.0,88,text_content,"‘You don’t need experience to know what they’ll do,’ Gurney said. "
45.0,89,text_content,center.’ 
45.0,90,text_content,"‘There’s a subtle piece of business,’ Paul said. ‘The CHOAM Company flag.’ "
45.0,91,text_content,"‘It’s the same as the flag at the other ships,’ the Fedaykin guard said. "
45.0,92,text_content,"‘I don’t understand,’ Stilgar said. "
45.0,93,text_content,is. He’s saying he doesn’t care if it’s an Atreides here or not.’ 
45.0,94,text_content,‘How long till the storm strikes the Shield Wall?’ Paul asked. 
45.0,95,text_content,than we expected. It’s a great-great-grandmother of a storm … perhaps even more than you wished.’ 
45.0,96,text_content,world it could not be more than I wished. Will it strike the Shield Wall full on?’ 
45.0,97,text_content,"‘Close enough to make no difference,’ Stilgar said. "

46.0,18,text_content,‘Incredible!’ the Emperor said. 
46.0,19,text_content,"One of the witch’s clawlike hands tapped the Emperor’s shoulder. She leaned forward, whispered in his ear. "
46.0,20,text_content,"The Emperor nodded, said: ‘Five days, Baron. Tell me, why aren’t you worried about his absence?’ "
46.0,21,text_content,"‘But I ‘am’ worried, Majesty!’ "
46.0,22,text_content,"The Emperor continued to stare at him, waiting. The Reverend Mother emitted a cackling laugh. "

46.0,24,text_content,"‘How clever of you, Baron,’ the Emperor said. ‘And where are your nephews, Rabban and the young Feyd-Rautha?’ "

46.0,38,text_content,"The Emperor glanced at his Truthsayer, turned back to scowl at the Baron. ‘And you have no other knowledge of this Muad’Dib?’ "
46.0,39,text_content,"‘A madman,’ the Baron said. ‘But all Fremen are a little mad.’ "
46.0,40,text_content,‘Mad?’

46.0,51,text_content,‘The sist …’ The Baron shifted his attention to the Emperor. ‘I do not understand.’ 
46.0,52,text_content,"‘I, too, sometimes err on the side of caution,’ the Emperor said. ‘It has been reported to me that your ‘uninhabited’ south polar regions exhibit evidence of human activity.’ "
46.0,53,text_content,‘But that’s impossible!’ the Baron protested. ‘The worms … there’s sand clear to the …’

46.0,58,text_content,"‘You see, Your Majesty!’ the Baron said. You see how they are!’ "

46.0,60,text_content,"‘Only a handful of our men got away,’ the Emperor said. ‘Got away! You hear that?’ "
46.0,61,text_content,"‘We’d have had them, too,’ the child said, ‘except for the flames.’ "

46.0,63,text_content,"‘We must attack in force,’ the Baron rasped. ‘We must destroy every last vestige of—’ "

46.0,65,text_content,"‘Majesty,’ the old Truthsayer said. "
46.0,66,text_content,"The Emperor lifted himself half off his throne. ‘What do you take me for, Baron?’ "
46.0,67,text_content,"The Baron took two backward steps, thinking: ‘It was Rabban. He has done this to me. Rabban has …’ "
46.0,68,text_content,it.’ 
46.0,69,text_content,"‘Majesty,’ the Baron pleaded. ‘What are you—’ "
46.0,70,text_content,‘Silence!’ 
46.0,71,text_content,"The old Bene Gesserit put a hand on the Emperor’s shoulder, leaned close to whisper in his ear. "
46.0,72,text_content,but I find the pleasure impossible to suppress.’ 
46.0,73,text_content,"Could you be as simple-minded as my Truthsayer suggests? Do you not recognize this child, daughter of your ally, Duke Leto?’ "
46.0,74,text_content,"‘My father was never his ally,’ the child said. ‘My father is dead and this old Harkonnen beast has never seen me before.’ "
46.0,75,text_content,The Baron was reduced to stupefied glaring. When he found his voice it was only to rasp: ‘Who?’ 
46.0,76,text_content,and I think he shall.’ 
46.0,77,text_content,"‘Be hush, child,’ the Emperor said, and he sank back into his throne, hand to chin, studying the Baron. "
46.0,78,text_content,"‘I do not take the Emperor’s orders,’ Alia said. She turned, looked up at the old Reverend Mother. ‘She knows.’ "
46.0,79,text_content,The Emperor glanced up at the Truthsayer. ‘What does she mean?’ 
46.0,80,text_content,It cannot come too quickly for that ‘child’ or for the one who spawned her!’ The old woman pointed a finger at Alia. ‘Get out of my mind!’ 
46.0,81,text_content,‘T-P?’ the Emperor whispered. He snapped his attention back to Alia. ‘By the Great Mother!’ 
46.0,82,text_content,"ones who gave me their memories. She stands in my mind! She cannot be there, but she is!’ "
46.0,83,text_content,‘What others?’ the Emperor demanded. ‘What’s this nonsense?’ 
46.0,84,text_content,our own has betrayed us.’ 
46.0,85,text_content,"took a deep breath, and held it. "
46.0,86,text_content,The old Reverend Mother groaned and staggered. 
46.0,87,text_content,"Alia opened her eyes. ‘That is how it was,’ she said. ‘A cosmic accident … and you played your part in it.’ "
46.0,88,text_content,"The Reverend Mother held out both hands, palms pushing the air toward Alia. "
46.0,89,text_content,"‘What is happening here?’ the Emperor demanded. ‘Child, can you truly project your thoughts into the mind of another?’ "
46.0,90,text_content,"‘That’s not how it is at all,’ Alia said. ‘Unless I’m born as you, I cannot think as you.’ "
46.0,91,text_content,at Alia. 
46.0,92,text_content,"‘Silence,’ the Emperor said, and he studied Alia. ‘Child, can you communicate with your brother?’ "
46.0,93,text_content,"‘My brother knows I’m here,’ Alia said. "
46.0,94,text_content,‘Can you tell him to surrender as the price of your life?’ 
46.0,95,text_content,"Alia smiled up at him with clear innocence. ‘I shall not do that,’ she said. "
46.0,96,text_content,"The Baron stumbled forward to stand beside Alia. ‘Majesty,’ he pleaded, ‘I knew nothing of—’ "
46.0,97,text_content,me?’ 
46.0,98,text_content,"‘I’ve already said I cannot read minds,’ she said, ‘but one doesn’t need telepathy to read your intentions.’ "
46.0,99,text_content,"The Emperor scowled. ‘Child, your cause is hopeless. I have but to rally my forces and reduce this planet to— "
46.0,100,text_content,"‘It’s not that simple,’ Alia said. She looked at the two Guildsmen. ‘Ask them.’ "
46.0,101,text_content,"‘It is not wise to go against my desires,’ the Emperor said. ‘You should not deny me the least thing.’ "
46.0,102,text_content,and heaven smiles upon him.’ 
46.0,103,text_content,"The Emperor surged to his feet. ‘This play has gone far enough, I will take your brother and this planet and grind them to—’ "
46.0,104,text_content,to the Emperor’s ship. The abrupt flicker-tightening of skin pressure told of a wide-area shield being activated. 
46.0,105,text_content,"‘I told you,’ Alia said. ‘My brother comes.’ "

46.0,114,text_content,‘The shield!’ one of the Sardaukar officers shouted. ‘The outer shield is down! They …’ 
46.0,115,text_content,His words were drowned in a metallic roaring as the shipwall behind the Emperor trembled and rocked. 
46.0,116,text_content,‘They’ve shot the nose off our ship!’ someone called. 
46.0,117,text_content,"Dust boiled through the room. Under its cover, Alia leaped up, ran toward the outer door. "

47.0,25,text_content,"Paul sighed, resting against the back of his chair. Presently, he said: ‘Bring me a captive Sardaukar. We must send a message to our Emperor. It’s time to discuss terms.’ "

47.0,65,text_content,It was as though she had been rendered incapable of ‘any’ emotion for her son. 
47.0,66,text_content,"here – never, never, never … "
47.0,67,text_content,"‘There should be a word-tension directly opposite to adab, the demanding memory,’ she thought. ‘There should be a word for memories that deny themselves.’ "
47.0,68,text_content,‘Where is Alia?’ she asked. 
47.0,69,text_content,their bodies for the water-recovery teams.’ 
47.0,70,text_content,‘Paul!’ 
47.0,71,text_content,kindness and cruelty?’ 
47.0,72,text_content,"can be hidden from you, that you see where others cannot see.’ "
47.0,73,text_content,‘A Bene Gesserit should ask about legends?’ he asked. 
47.0,74,text_content,"‘I’ve had a hand in whatever you are,’ she admitted, ‘but you mustn’t expect me to—’ "
47.0,75,text_content,Kwisatz Haderach.’ 
47.0,76,text_content,"Jessica tried to swallow in a dry throat. Presently, she said: ‘Once you denied to me that you were the Kwisatz Haderach.’ "
47.0,77,text_content,will be announced any moment. Stand beside me. I wish a clear view of them. My future bride will be among them.’ 
47.0,78,text_content,‘Paul!’Jessica snapped. ‘Don’t make the mistake your father made!’ 
47.0,79,text_content,what you made me that I cannot feel the need for revenge?’ 
47.0,80,text_content,"‘Even on the innocent?’ she asked, and she thought: ‘He must not make the mistakes I made.’ "
47.0,81,text_content,"‘There are no innocent any more,’ Paul said. "
47.0,82,text_content,"‘Tell that to Chani,’ Jessica said, and gestured toward the passage from the rear of the Residency. "
47.0,83,text_content,"were thrown back, face mask fastened aside. She walked with a fragile uncertainty as she crossed the room to stand beside Jessica. "
47.0,84,text_content,"Paul saw the marks of tears on her cheeks — ‘She gives water to the dead.’ He felt a pang of grief strike through him, but it was as though he could only feel this thing through Chani’s presence. "
47.0,85,text_content,"‘He is dead, beloved,’ Chani said. ‘Our son is dead.’ "
47.0,86,text_content,"her aside, gestured to Stilgar. "
47.0,87,text_content,"‘Muad’Dib,’ Stilgar said. "
47.0,88,text_content,in the center of the room. They will be kept at a distance of ten meters from me unless I command otherwise.’ 
47.0,89,text_content,"‘As you command, Muad’Dib.’ "
47.0,90,text_content,"As Stilgar turned to obey, Paul heard the awed muttering of Bremen guards: ‘You see? He knew! No one told him, but he knew!’ "
47.0,91,text_content,"Stilgar, then moved to Paul’s side, a strange look in his eyes. "
47.0,92,text_content,"‘Will I lose Gurney, too?’ Paul wondered. ‘The way I lost Stilgar – losing a friend to gain a creature?’ "
47.0,93,text_content,‘Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen is with them. Shall I cut him out?’ 
47.0,94,text_content,‘Leave him.’ 
47.0,95,text_content,you their message.’ 
47.0,96,text_content,‘Let them threaten.’ 
47.0,97,text_content,‘Paul!’ Jessica hissed behind him. ‘He’s talking about the Guild!’ 
47.0,98,text_content,"‘I’ll pull their fangs presently,’ Paul said. "
47.0,99,text_content,they swam might produce a new host when the old one died. 
47.0,100,text_content,that leads ever downward into stagnation. 
47.0,101,text_content,"‘Let them look closely at their new host,’ Paul thought. "
47.0,102,text_content,"‘There’s also a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who says she’s a friend of your mother,’ Gurney said. "
47.0,103,text_content,‘My mother has no Bene Gesserit friends.’ 
47.0,104,text_content,he’s to be left among ‘em.’ 
47.0,105,text_content,‘You left Thufir among those—’ 
47.0,106,text_content,the other side.’

47.0,108,text_content,the sand that had drifted into the Residency. 
47.0,109,text_content,"disarray. His uniform’s left sleeve had been ripped along the inner seam. He was beltless and without weapons, but his presence moved with him like a force-shield bubble that kept his immediate area open. "
47.0,110,text_content,of shuffling and of staring faces. 
47.0,111,text_content,"Gaius Helen Mohiam glaring beneath her black hood, and beside her the narrow furtiveness of Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen. "
47.0,112,text_content,"‘There’s a face time betrayed to me,’ Paul thought. "
47.0,113,text_content,– not in time or out of it. It was a face he felt he should know and the feeling carried with it a marker of fear. 
47.0,114,text_content,‘Why should I fear that man?’ he wondered. 
47.0,115,text_content,"He leaned toward his mother, whispered: ‘That man to the left of the Reverend Mother, the evil-looking one – who is that?’ "
47.0,116,text_content,before us. A genetic-eunuch … and a killer.’ 
47.0,117,text_content,associations spread through the possible futures – but never once had Count Fenring appeared within those prescient visions. 
47.0,118,text_content,seen his moment of death. 
47.0,119,text_content,‘Have I been denied a glimpse of this man because he is the one who kills me?’ Paul wondered. 
47.0,120,text_content,"attention briefly: Sardaukar officers measuring the preparations within this room, planning and scheming yet for a way to turn defeat into victory. "
47.0,121,text_content,time vision had shown him in many aspects: Irulan. 
47.0,122,text_content,"‘There’s my key,’ he thought. "
47.0,123,text_content,"stained lips, the hunched shoulders, the look of fragile age about him. "
47.0,124,text_content,"‘There’s Thufir Hawat,’ Paul said. ‘Let him stand free, Gurney.’ "
47.0,125,text_content,"‘M’Lord,’ Gurney said. "
47.0,126,text_content,"‘Let him stand free,’ Paul repeated. "
47.0,127,text_content,Gurney nodded. 
47.0,128,text_content,"Hawat shambled forward as a Fremen lance was lifted and replaced behind him. The rheumy eyes peered at Paul, measuring, seeking. "
47.0,129,text_content,"Paul stepped forward one pace, sensed the tense, waiting movement of the Emperor and his people. "
47.0,130,text_content,You needn’t forgive.’ 
47.0,131,text_content,"Paul waited, but his mother remained silent. "
47.0,132,text_content,"‘Thufir, old friend,’ Paul said, ‘as you can see, my back is toward no door.’ "
47.0,133,text_content,"‘The universe is full of doors,’ Hawat said. "
47.0,134,text_content,‘Am I my father’s son?’ Paul asked. 
47.0,135,text_content,"‘More like your grandfather’s,’ Hawat rasped. ‘You’ve his manner and the look of him in your eyes.’ "
47.0,136,text_content,"a pace, hands at his side, seeing the look of awareness grow in Hawat’s eyes. "
47.0,137,text_content,"‘He realizes that I know of the treachery,’ Paul thought. "
47.0,138,text_content,"me, do it now.’ "
47.0,139,text_content,his hands. 
47.0,140,text_content,"‘Is there pain, old friend?’ Paul asked. "
47.0,141,text_content,needle? Do you think that I who’ve given my life to service of the Atreides would give them less now?’ 
47.0,142,text_content,"the floor, straightened and signed for guardsmen to carry the body away. "
47.0,143,text_content,Silence held the hall while his command was obeyed. 
47.0,144,text_content,A look of deadly waiting held the Emperor’s face now. Eyes that had never admitted fear admitted it at last. 
47.0,145,text_content,"the Bene Gesserit controlled atonals, carrying in it every shade of contempt and scorn that Paul could put there. "
47.0,146,text_content,"‘Bene Gesserit-trained indeed,’ Paul thought. "
47.0,147,text_content,"be more remote from fact. You have violated the Convention, used atomics against—’ "
47.0,148,text_content,"Majesty, to ask your explanation for some of your strange activities.’ "
47.0,149,text_content,and they’ll—’ 
47.0,150,text_content,"two Guildsmen, spoke aside to Gurney. ‘Are those the Guild agents, Gurney, the two fat ones dressed in gray over there?’ "
47.0,151,text_content,"‘Yes, m’Lord.’ "
47.0,152,text_content,"After this, you’ll ask my permission before—’ "
47.0,153,text_content,be under embargo for your—’ 
47.0,154,text_content,Arrakis … forever.’ 
47.0,155,text_content,‘Are you mad?’ the tall Guildsman demanded. He fell back half a step. 
47.0,156,text_content,"‘You grant that I have the power to do this thing, then?’ Paul asked. "
47.0,157,text_content,"The Guildsman seemed to stare into space for a moment, then: ‘Yes, you could do it, but you must not.’ "
47.0,158,text_content,"‘Ah-h-h,’ Paul said and nodded to himself. ‘Guild navigators, both of you, eh?’ "
47.0,159,text_content,‘Yes!’ 
47.0,160,text_content,to be deprived of the spice liquor once you’re addicted?’ 
47.0,161,text_content,"clusters on their isolated planets. You know, I might do this thing out of pure spite … or out of ennui.’ "
47.0,162,text_content,"‘Let us talk this over privately,’ the taller Guildsman said. ‘I’m sure we can come to some compromise that is—’ "
47.0,163,text_content,soon there’ll be no need for us to talk.’ He nodded toward his communications men at the side of the hall. ‘You may use our equipment.’ 
47.0,164,text_content,"‘First we must discuss this,’ the tall Guildsman said. ‘We cannot just—’ "
47.0,165,text_content,not here to discuss or to negotiate or to compromise. You will obey my orders or suffer the ‘immediate’ consequences!’ 
47.0,166,text_content,"‘He means it,’ the shorter Guildsman said. And Paul saw the fear grip them. "
47.0,167,text_content,Slowly the two crossed to the Fremen communications equipment. 
47.0,168,text_content,‘Will they obey?’ Gurney asked. 
47.0,169,text_content,Every Guild navigator on every ship over us can look ahead to that same wall. They’ll obey.’ 
47.0,170,text_content,"assurance that you’d keep the spice flowing. You’ve failed them, Majesty. Do you know the consequences?’ "
47.0,171,text_content,‘Nobody ‘permitted’ me to—’ 
47.0,172,text_content,it without destroying the river.’ 
47.0,173,text_content,"The Emperor brushed a hand through his red hair, glanced at the backs of the two Guildsmen. "
47.0,174,text_content,"tricks, but once they’ve used the spice liquor, the others no longer work.’ "
47.0,175,text_content,"The old woman pulled her shapeless black robes around her, pressed forward out of the crowd to stand at the barrier lances. "
47.0,176,text_content,"‘Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam,’ Paul said. ‘It has been a long time since Caladan, hasn’t it?’ "
47.0,177,text_content,even the abomination of your daughter.’ 
47.0,178,text_content,"Paul stilled a cold, piercing anger, said: ‘You’ve never had the right or cause to forgive my mother anything!’ "
47.0,179,text_content,The old woman locked eyes with him. 
47.0,180,text_content,You’ll find me there staring out at you!’ 
47.0,181,text_content,The old woman dropped her gaze. 
47.0,182,text_content,‘Have you nothing to say?’ Paul demanded. 
47.0,183,text_content,"‘I welcomed you to the ranks of humans,’ she muttered. ‘Don’t besmirch that.’ "
47.0,184,text_content,… will … never … do … her … bidding!’ 
47.0,185,text_content,‘Jessica!’ the old woman screamed. ‘Silence him!’ 
47.0,186,text_content,"‘Silence him yourself,’Jessica said. "
47.0,187,text_content,me or bend me to a single thing your scheming desires.’ 
47.0,188,text_content,"‘Jessica, what have you done?’ the old woman demanded. "
47.0,189,text_content,human breeding and intermix a select few according to your master plan! How little you understand of what—’ 
47.0,190,text_content,‘You mustn’t speak of these things!’ the old woman hissed. 
47.0,191,text_content,‘Silence!’ Paul roared. The word seemed to take substance as it twisted through the air between them under Paul’s control. 
47.0,192,text_content,"psyche. ‘Jessica,’ she whispered. ‘Jessica.’ "
47.0,193,text_content,"‘I remember your gom jabbar,’ Paul said. ‘You remember mine. I can kill you with a word.’ "
47.0,194,text_content,The Fremen around the hall glanced knowingly at each other. Did the legend not say: ‘‘And his word shall carry death eternal to those who stand against righteousness. ‘’? 
47.0,195,text_content,"he said: ‘Majesty, we both know the way out of our difficulty.’ "
47.0,196,text_content,"The Emperor glanced at his daughter, back to Paul. ‘You dare? You! An adventurer without family, a nobody from—’ "
47.0,197,text_content,"‘You’ve already admitted who I am,’ Paul said. ‘Royal kinsman, you said. Let’s stop this nonsense.’ "
47.0,198,text_content,"‘I am your ruler,’ the Emperor said. "
47.0,199,text_content,Paul glanced at the Guildsmen standing now at the communications equipment and facing him. One of them nodded. 
47.0,200,text_content,"‘I could force it,’ Paul said. "
47.0,201,text_content,‘You will not dare!’ the Emperor grated. 
47.0,202,text_content,Paul merely stared at him. 
47.0,203,text_content,"The Princess Royal put a hand on her father’s arm. ‘Father,’ she said, and her voice was silky soft, soothing. "
47.0,204,text_content,that—’ 
47.0,205,text_content,"‘But here’s a man fit to be your son,’ she said. "
47.0,206,text_content,"The old Reverend Mother, her composure regained, forced her way to the Emperor’s side, leaned close to his ear and whispered. "
47.0,207,text_content,"‘She pleads your case,’Jessica said. "
47.0,208,text_content,"Paul continued to look at the golden-haired Princess. Aside to his mother, he said: ‘That’s Irulan, the oldest, isn’t it?’ "
47.0,209,text_content,‘Yes.’ 
47.0,210,text_content,"Chani moved up on Paul’s other side, said: ‘Do you wish me to leave, Muad’Dib?’ "
47.0,211,text_content,He glanced at her. ‘Leave? You’ll never again leave my side.’ 
47.0,212,text_content,"‘There’s nothing binding between us,’ Chani said. "
47.0,213,text_content,to see this room later through your wisdom.’ 
47.0,214,text_content,"The Emperor and his Truthsayer were carrying on a heated, low-voiced argument. "
47.0,215,text_content,is the one they’ve groomed for it.’ 
47.0,216,text_content,‘Was that their plan?’Jessica said. 
47.0,217,text_content,‘Isn’t it obvious?’ Paul asked. 
47.0,218,text_content,in which I instructed you.’ 
47.0,219,text_content,"Paul glanced at her, caught a cold smile on her lips. "
47.0,220,text_content,As evil a face as ever I saw. You promised me once that—’ 
47.0,221,text_content,"‘Thank you, Gurney,’ Paul said. "
47.0,222,text_content,"‘It’s the na-Baron … Baron, now that the old man’s dead,’ Gurney said. ‘He’ll do for what I’ve in—’ "
47.0,223,text_content,"‘Can you take him, Gurney?’ "
47.0,224,text_content,‘M’Lord jests!’ 
47.0,225,text_content,"‘That argument between the Emperor and his witch has gone on long enough, don’t you think, Mother?’ "
47.0,226,text_content,She nodded. ‘Indeed.’ 
47.0,227,text_content,"Paul raised his voice, called out to the Emperor: ‘Majesty, is there a Harkonnen among you?’ "
47.0,228,text_content,"the protection of your ducal word,’ he said. "
47.0,229,text_content,if a Harkonnen is merely hiding behind a technicality out of cowardice.’ 
47.0,230,text_content,The Emperor’s smile was calculating. ‘Anyone accepted into the Imperial company is a member of my entourage.’ 
47.0,231,text_content,If he—’ 
47.0,232,text_content,coward while you hide among your women and offer to send a lackey against me!’ 
47.0,233,text_content,are strict rules for kanly.’ 
47.0,234,text_content,"‘Paul, put a stop to this,’Jessica said. "
47.0,235,text_content,"‘M’Lord,’ Gurney said, ‘you promised me my day against the Harkonnens.’ "
47.0,236,text_content,now that the universe focused on this moment. 
47.0,237,text_content,"‘There’s no need for this,’Jessica said. ‘There are easier ways, Paul’ "
47.0,238,text_content,"an assassin, all the old familiar ways.’ "
47.0,239,text_content,"dark and ridged. ‘You owe it to me, m’Lord!’ "
47.0,240,text_content,‘Have you suffered more from them than I?’ Paul asked. 
47.0,241,text_content,"‘My sister,’ Gurney rasped. ‘My years in the slave pits—’ "
47.0,242,text_content,or succor … and one more thing: it is now kanly and you know as well as I the rules that must prevail.’ 
47.0,243,text_content,"shoe because it’d been contaminated. Call in an executioner, if you must, or let me do it, but don’t offer yourself to— "
47.0,244,text_content,"‘Muad’Dib need not do this thing,’ Chani said. "
47.0,245,text_content,"He glanced at her, saw the fear for him in her eyes. ‘But the Duke Paul must,’ he said. "
47.0,246,text_content,‘This is a Harkonnen animal!’ Gurney rasped. 
47.0,247,text_content,"‘But this being has human shape, Gurney, and deserves human doubt.’ "
47.0,248,text_content,Gurney said: ‘If he so much as—’ 
47.0,249,text_content,"‘Please stand aside,’ Paul said. He hefted the crysknife, pushed Gurney gently aside. "
47.0,250,text_content,thing you can do for him now.’ And she thought: ‘Great Mother! What irony.’ 
47.0,251,text_content,that the ripple and gather of muscles could be followed under the skin. 
47.0,252,text_content,flaccid and—’ 
47.0,253,text_content,"‘I want no special advantage for this one,’ Paul said. ‘Step back out of my way.’ "
47.0,254,text_content,"prattle, is that what clouds his reason?’ "
47.0,255,text_content,do. 
47.0,256,text_content,‘Is it this religious prattle?’ Gurney insisted. 
47.0,257,text_content,"‘Be silent,’Jessica whispered. ‘And pray.’ "
47.0,258,text_content,"guards. ‘One of your rabble has my belt and short blade. If Feyd-Rautha wishes it, he may meet you with my blade in his hand.’ "
47.0,259,text_content,"‘I wish it,’ Feyd-Rautha said, and Paul saw the elation on the man’s face. "
47.0,260,text_content,"‘He’s overconfident,’ Paul thought. ‘There’s a natural advantage I can accept.’ "
47.0,261,text_content,with his foot. ‘Clear the Imperial rabble back against the wall and let the Harkonnen stand clear.’ 
47.0,262,text_content,remained standing near the communications equipment. They frowned at Paul in obvious indecision. 
47.0,263,text_content,"organism in this moment, experiencing a kind of sexual heat that could override any barrier. "
47.0,264,text_content,even over the Guild which must have the spice to exist. 
47.0,265,text_content,down to a fighting girdle with a mail core. 
47.0,266,text_content,"that my spirit might lead them. And if I live, they’ll say nothing can oppose Muad’Dib.’ "
47.0,267,text_content,"‘Is the Atreides ready?’ Feyd-Rautha called, using the words of the ancient kanly ritual. "
47.0,268,text_content,indicating that Feyd-Rautha should advance and take it. 
47.0,269,text_content,the yokel had no way of knowing he faced more weapons than a knife here. 
47.0,270,text_content,"‘Let us see if you’re proof against poison!’ Feyd-Rautha thought. He saluted Paul with the Emperor’s blade, said: ‘Meet your death, fool.’ "
47.0,271,text_content,own milk-white crysknife pointing out as though an extension of his arm. 
47.0,272,text_content,"They circled each other, bare feet grating on the floor, watching with eyes intent for the slightest opening. "
47.0,273,text_content,"‘How beautifully you dance,’ Feyd-Rautha said. "
47.0,274,text_content,"‘He’s a talker,’ Paul thought. ‘There’s another weakness. He grows uneasy in the face of silence.’ "
47.0,275,text_content,‘Have you been shriven?’ Feyd-Rautha asked. 
47.0,276,text_content,"Still, Paul circled in silence. "
47.0,277,text_content,was the Kwisatz Haderach. But the words forced her to focus on the only thing that mattered to her here. 
47.0,278,text_content,This could be a major catastrophe for the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme. 
47.0,279,text_content,"an unmeasured factor, and Alia, the abomination. "
47.0,280,text_content,for its journey?’ 
47.0,281,text_content,"Paul smiled, circling to the right, alert, his black thoughts suppressed by the needs of the moment. "
47.0,282,text_content,"Feyd-Rautha leaped, feinting with right hand, but with the knife shifted in a blur to his left hand. "
47.0,283,text_content,"conditioning as some Paul had seen, and he sensed that Feyd-Rautha had fought before against unshielded foes. "
47.0,284,text_content,‘Does an Atreides run or stand and fight?’ Feyd-Rautha asked. 
47.0,285,text_content,insurance of success. Take your time and be sure.’’ 
47.0,286,text_content,straightened. 
47.0,287,text_content,fighting girdle could protect his entire side. It was the action of a man trained to the shield and with a knife in both hands. 
47.0,288,text_content,‘Or …’ And Paul hesitated … the girdle was more than it ‘seemed.’ 
47.0,289,text_content,The Harkonnen appeared too confident against a man who’d this day led the forces of victory against Sardaukar legions. 
47.0,290,text_content,of dirt.’ 
47.0,291,text_content,"‘If it’s a flip-dart,’ Paul thought, ‘it’s a cunning one. The girdle shows no signs of tampering.’ "
47.0,292,text_content,‘Why don’t you speak?’ Feyd-Rautha demanded. 
47.0,293,text_content,the pressure of silence was building. 
47.0,294,text_content,"‘You smile, eh?’ Feyd-Rautha asked. And he leaped in mid-sentence. "
47.0,295,text_content,Here was more of an opponent than he had expected. There would be tricks within tricks within tricks. 
47.0,296,text_content,live to see it.’ 
47.0,297,text_content,"And Paul recalled that Idaho had once said, ‘‘Expect only what happens in the fight. That way you’ll never be surprised.’’ "
47.0,298,text_content,"Again the two circled each other, crouched, cautious. "
47.0,299,text_content,"poison on the blade! But how could there be? His own men had handled the weapon, snooped it before passing it. They were too well trained to miss an obvious thing like that. "
47.0,300,text_content,Will she deserve my special attentions?’ 
47.0,301,text_content,"strong enough to slow the muscles it touched. His enemies had their own plans within plans, their own stacked treacheries. "
47.0,302,text_content,"Again Feyd-Rautha leaped, stabbing. "
47.0,303,text_content,meet the downflashing arm on the crysknife point. 
47.0,304,text_content,paleness of jaw betrayed the acid pain where Paul had cut him.
